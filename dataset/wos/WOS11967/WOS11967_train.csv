"Multi-vent regulators are widely used in Egypt. Operation system of gates affects the characteristics of the flow downstream (DS) of multi-vent regulators. The current study aimed toward introducing the artificial intelligence technique as a new modeling tool in the prediction of the characteristics of the flow downstream of multi-vent regulators under the management and operating systems of multi-gates. Specially Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is utilized in the current study in conjunction with experimental data to predict the relative length of the submerged hydraulic jump (HJ) occured DS of multi-vent regulators under the different cases of gates operation. The results show that ANN technique is very successful in simulating the relative submerged hydraulic jump length occurred in stilling basins downstream of multi-vent regulators better than multiple linear regression (MLR).

"This article presents basic concepts and recent research directions about the stability of sampled-data systems with aperiodic sampling. We focus mainly on the stability problem for systems with arbitrary time-varying sampling intervals which has been addressed in several areas of research in Control Theory. Systems with aperiodic sampling can be seen as time-delay systems, hybrid systems, Input/Output interconnections, discrete-time systems with time-varying parameters, etc. The goal of the article is to provide a structural overview of the progress made on the stability analysis problem. Without being exhaustive, which would be neither possible nor useful, we try to bring together results from diverse communities and present them in a unified manner. For each of the existing approaches, the basic concepts, fundamental results, converse stability theorems (when available), and relations with the other approaches are discussed in detail. Results concerning extensions of Lyapunov and frequency domain methods for systems with aperiodic sampling are recalled, as they allow to derive constructive stability conditions. Furthermore, numerical criteria are presented while indicating the sources of conservatism, the problems that remain open and the possible directions of improvement. At last, some emerging research directions, such as the design of stabilizing sampling sequences, are briefly discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"Transportation Engineers face many problems in using Sand Dunes available in huge quantities through the desert areas in Iraq as construction Materials for Roads. This study consists of using Sand Dunes as local material in road construction. Two approaches are adopted to achieve this goal; the first is carrying out laboratory tests through simulation of three layers of paved road, using a steel box model where Subgrade layer represented by Sand Dunes at relative density 55.7% (in situe Value). The study oriented as well to the improvement of sand dunes through using reinforcement with two types of Geosynthetic material. Two models were studied, one of which is reinforced by single layer of geotextile at subbase-subgrade interface and the other using single layer of geogrid at the same depth to improve the subgrade, grouting technique is used through the injection of the subgrade with a mixture of cement, bentonite, and water. Using of geotextile and geogrid, leads to increase the number of passes 108.53%, 78.05% respectively. The using of injection technique increase the number of passes about 18.29%. FE approach using Abaqus program was applied to find out displacement distribution through build pavement structure model. The results obtained from both laboratory and finite elements are very much encouraging with using Sand Dune as construction materials for Roads. However, using reinforcement in between subbase-subgrade interface also satisfied the minimum stability requirements for roads foundation structure with sand dunes as subgrade layer.

"Compressed sensing (CS) demonstrates that sparse signals can be estimated from underdetermined linear systems. Distributed CS (DCS) further reduces the number of measurements by considering joint sparsity within signal ensembles. DCS with jointly sparse signals has applications in multisensor acoustic sensing, magnetic resonance imaging with multiple coils, remote sensing, and array signal processing. Multimeasurement vector (MMV) problems consider the estimation of jointly sparse signals under the DCS framework. Two related MMV settings are studied. In the first setting, each signal vector is measured by a different independent and identically distributed (i. i. d.) measurement matrix, while in the second setting, all signal vectors are measured by the same i. i. d. matrix. Replica analysis is performed for these two MMV settings, and the minimum mean squared error (MMSE), which turns out to be identical for both settings, is obtained as a function of the noise variance and number of measurements. To showcase the application of MMV models, the MMSE's of complex CS problems with both real and complex measurement matrices are also analyzed. Multiple performance regions for MMV are identified where the MMSE behaves differently as a function of the noise variance and the number of measurements. Belief propagation (BP) is a CS signal estimation framework that often achieves the MMSE asymptotically. A phase transition for BP is identified. This phase transition, verified by numerical results, separates the regions where BP achieves the MMSE and where it is suboptimal. Numerical results also illustrate that more signal vectors in the jointly sparse signal ensemble lead to a better phase transition.

"The notion Internet of Things (IoT) means all things in the global network can be interconnected and accessed. Wireless sensor network (WSN) is one of the most important applications of the notion and is widely used in nearly all scopes. In 2014, Hsieh et al. presented an improved authentication scheme for WSNs. But it has several weaknesses, including no session key, lack of mutual authentication and under the insider attack, the off-line guessing attack, the user forgery attack and the sensor capture attack. To avoid the weaknesses, we present a new authentication scheme which is also for WSNs. Then we employ the random oracle model to show the formal proof, and use the protocol analyzing tool Proverif to list the formal verification process. Compared with some recent schemes for WSNs via the aspects of security properties, the proposed scheme overcomes the common problems and fits for the security properties of IoT.

"We consider the problem of allocating the cost of a transmission system among load and generator entities. It is a known instance of the classical cooperative game theoretic problem. To solve this problem is a formidable task, as we are dealing with a combinatorial game with transferable utilities. This is an NP hard problem. Therefore, it suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Marginal pricing is a pragmatic alternative to solve this problem since both Kirchhoff current law and voltage law are strictly adhered to. However, the generic complexity of cooperative game theoretic problems cannot be just wished away. It now manifests as the difficulty in choosing an economic slack bus, which may even be dispersed. We propose the application of min-max fairness policy to solve this problem and give an algorithm which will run in polynomial time. During network cost allocation, min-max fairness policy minimizes the maximum regret among participating entities at each step. Maximum regret is measured in terms of price, and lexicographic application of this principle leads to a fair and unique equilibrium price vector. Results on a large network demonstrate fairness as well as tractability of the proposed approach.

"BACKGROUND: Opiate abuse and overdose reached epidemic levels in the United States. However, despite significant advances in animal and in vitro models, little knowledge has been directly accrued regarding the neurobiology of the opiate-addicted human brain. METHODS: We used postmortem human brain specimens from a homogeneous European Caucasian population of heroin users for transcriptional and epigenetic profiling, as well as direct assessment of chromatin accessibility in the striatum, a brain region central to reward and emotion. A rat heroin self-administration model was used to obtain translational molecular and behavioral insights. RESULTS: Our transcriptome approach revealed marked impairments related to glutamatergic neurotransmission and chromatin remodeling in the human striatum. A series of biochemical experiments tracked the specific location of the epigenetic disturbances to hyperacetylation of lysine 27 of histone H3, showing dynamic correlations with heroin use history and acute opiate toxicology. Targeted investigation of GRIA1, a glutamatergic gene implicated in drug-seeking behavior, verified the increased enrichment of lysine-27 acetylated histone H3 at discrete loci, accompanied by enhanced chromatin accessibility at hyperacetylated regions in the gene body. Analogous epigenetic impairments were detected in the striatum of heroin self-administering rats. Using this translational model, we showed that bromodomain inhibitor JQ1, which blocks the functional readout of acetylated lysines, reduced heroin self-administration and cue-induced drug-seeking behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our data suggest that heroin-related histone H3 hyperacetylation contributes to glutamatergic transcriptional changes that underlie addiction behavior and identify JQ1 as a promising candidate for targeted clinical interventions in heroin use disorder.

"Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the contribution of lymphatic tissue to heterotopic ossification (HO). Background: HO is the pathologic development of ectopic bone within soft tissues often following severe trauma. Characterization of the tissue niche supporting HO is critical to identifying therapies directed against this condition. Lymphangiogenesis is upregulated during incidents of trauma, thereby coincident with the niche supportive of HO. We hypothesized that lymphatic tissues play a critical role in HO formation. Methods: Mice underwent hindlimb Achilles' tendon transection and dorsal burn injury (burn/tenotomy) to induce HO. The popliteal and inguinal lymph nodes were excised ipsilateral to the tenotomy site. Flow cytometry and immunostaining were used to quantify and localize lymphoendothelium. MicroCT was used to quantify HO. Results: Enrichment of mature lymphatic tissues was noted 2 weeks after injury at the tendon transection sites when compared with the contralateral, intact tendon based on LYVE1+ tubules (10.9% vs 0.8%, P < 0.05). Excision of the inguinal and popliteal nodes with draining popliteal lymphatic vessel significantly decreased the presence of mature lymphoendothelium 2 weeks after injury (10.9% vs 3.3%, P < 0.05). Bone-cartilage-stromal progenitor cells (CD105+/AlphaV+/Tie2-/CD45-/CD90-/BP1-) were also significantly decreased after lymph node excision (10.2% vs 0.5%, P < 0.05). A significant decrease was noted in the volume of de novo HOpresent within the soft tissues (0.12 mm(3) vs 0.02 mm(3)). Conclusion: These findings suggest that lymphatic vessels are intimately linked with the de novo formation bone within soft tissues following trauma, and their presence may facilitate bone formation.

"The first tool presented in this paper is a generic factory cost model that can estimate various costs at multiple levels of any manufacturing plant. The model is activity-based which means that the cost of each manufacturing operation is calculated and then summed up so that the true -per-hour pound factory cost rate as well as the exact unit cost (i.e. manufacturing cost) of an unlimited number of different components can be estimated. The second tool is a scalable cost model that estimates the unit cost of future integrally bladed disc (blisk) designs which are used by the aerospace industry in gas turbine compressors. The tool multiplies the machine cost rates, calculated by the factory cost model, by the operation times derived from blisk scaling rules. As the operation times often depend on the number of blades, the disc diameter and other design variables, many scaling rules are based on the correlation between operation times and certain design parameters. Conversely, the remaining process times are constant because they are independent of the blisk geometry. As future process times can only be estimated and the correlation between operation times and design parameters is never perfect, all operation times have uncertainty distributions. These are cascaded through the model to generate a probability distribution of the unit cost. Through the interactive exchange of detailed cost information at the manufacturing operation level as well as extrapolated operation times, the two cost models facilitate design and manufacturing engineering to concurrently optimise blisk designs and manufacturing processes in terms of cost.

"Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is a practice of growing importance in the United Kingdom, particularly in the southeast of England where the water availability per person is even less than in many Mediterranean countries. Although there is a huge amount of rainfall in the north and west of England and Wales, water resources in the southeast and east of England are under pressure due to the growing population and the changing climate. Therefore, RWH becomes particularly important to reduce the dependence on the mains water supply. In the present study, suitable areas for RWH in the UK have been identified using a geographic information system-based decision support system (DSS) and remote sensing. The DSS undertakes a combination of thematic layers such as rainfall surplus, slope, curve number, land cover/use, and soil texture. The spatial extents of suitability areas for RWH were identified using multi-criteria evaluation. The spatial distribution of the suitability map shows that the excellent suitable areas for RWH are in the northwest of UK but less suitable areas in the northern and eastern parts. On average, the suitability for RWH in the UK was found that 18.95 and 27.25 % of the area are excellent and good, about 23.53 % is moderate, whilst 30.26 and 0.02 % are unsuitable and poor, respectively. The use of a number of RWH sites in the excellent areas is recommended to ensure successful implementation of RWH systems.

"The reproducibility of experiments is one of the main principles of the scientific method. However, numerical N-body experiments, especially those of planetary systems, are currently not reproducible. In themost optimistic scenario, they can only be replicated in an approximate or statistical sense. Even if authors share their full source code and initial conditions, differences in compilers, libraries, operating systems or hardware often lead to qualitatively different results. We provide a new set of easy-to-use, open-source tools that address the above issues, allowing for exact (bit-by-bit) reproducibility of N-body experiments. In addition to generating completely reproducible integrations, we show that our framework also offers novel and innovative ways to analyse these simulations. As an example, we present a high-accuracy integration of the Solar system spanning 10 Gyr, requiring several weeks to run on a modern CPU. In our framework, we can not only easily access simulation data at predefined intervals for which we save snapshots, but at any time during the integration. We achieve this by integrating an on-demand reconstructed simulation forward in time from the nearest snapshot. This allows us to extract arbitrary quantities at any point in the saved simulation exactly (bit-by-bit), and within seconds rather than weeks. We believe that the tools we present in this paper offer a new paradigm for how N-body simulations are run, analysed and shared across the community.

"Advances in forensic identification using molecular genetics are helpful in resolving some historical mysteries. The aim of this study was to confirm the authenticity of shrunken-head artifacts exhibited by two Polish museums. Shrunken heads, known as tsantsas, were headhunting trophies of South American Indians (Jivaroan). A special preparation preserved their hair and facial appearance. However, it was quite common to offer counterfeit shrunken heads of sloths or monkeys to collectors of curiosities. We sampled small skin specimens of four shrunken-head skin from the museum collection from Warsaw and Krakow, Poland. Following genomic DNA isolation, highly polymorphic short tandem repeats were genotyped using a commercial chemistry and DNA sequencing analyzer. Haplogroups of human Y chromosome were identified. We obtained an informative genetic profile of genomic short tandem repeats from all the samples of shrunken heads. Moreover, amplification of amelogenin loci allowed for sex determination. All four studied shrunken heads were of human origin. In two ones, a shared Y-chromosome haplogroup Q characteristic for Indigenous Americans was detected. Another artifact was counterfeited because Y-chromosome haplogroup I2 was found, characteristic for the Southeastern European origin. Commercial genetic methods of identification can be applied successfully in studies on the origin and authenticity of some unusual collection items.

An attempt is made to design a mix-network (Mix-Net) using elliptic curve cryptography based on cellular automata which creates a hard to trace communication to protect the anonymity of the sender and encrypt the sensitive information to avoid any eavesdropper trying to access the data during transmission. CAEC 2 M provides also confidentiality, integrity and authentication.

"In this paper, we present an overview of the entropy production in fluid dynamics in a systematic way. First of all, we clarify a rigorous derivation of the incompressible limit for the Navier-Stokes-Fourier system of equations based on the asymptotic analysis, which is a very well known mathematical technique used to derive macroscopic limits of kinetic equations (Chapman-Enskog expansion and Hilbert expansion are popular methodologies). This allows to overcome the theoretical limits of assuming that the material derivative of the density simply vanishes. Moreover, we show that the fundamental Gibbs relation in classical thermodynamics can be applied to non-equilibrium flows for generalizing the entropy and for expressing the second law of thermodynamics in case of both incompressible and compressible flows. This is consistent with the thermodynamics of irreversible processes and it is an essential condition for the design and optimization of fluid flow devices. Summarizing a theoretical framework valid at different regimes (both incompressible and compressible) sheds light on entropy production in fluid mechanics, with broad implications in applied mechanics.

"Aim To investigate whether morphological variation in a continental radiation of lizards (Chamaeleonidae) was driven by ecological opportunity. Location KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Methods Chameleons from all morphotypes were genotyped (n=279) using 10 microsatellite and one mitochondrial marker (n=130). Genetic spatial structure was examined in a Bayesian framework and compared to ecomorphological forms, to identify distinct chameleon groups using a total evidence approach. Ecological niche modelling projected back to the Last Glacial Maximum and the Last Interglacial was used to make inferences regarding the processes that may have facilitated diversification through ecological opportunity. Results For the three inland groups, genetic and morphological evidence were in agreement suggesting these are candidate species. However, there was discordance in evidence for populations from coastal regions, although the different time-scales of the data allow us to make some inferences regarding this disparity. The microsatellite data suggest at least three independent origins of coastal chameleons, although all three clusters show the same ecomorph, which indicates convergence of phenotype in a similar environment. The species distribution models revealed high niche stability among inland groups, suggesting the presence of refugia for these chameleons; whereas the coastal niche is more dynamic and likely resulted in recent origins of these groups. Main Conclusions A dynamic climatic niche and corresponding vegetation shifts are likely to have shaped contrasting ecomorphological and genetic patterns within this continental radiation by creating ecological opportunity for the coastal chamleons. In contrast, inland groups are in climatically stable regions, and show concordance between lines of evidence, suggesting that niche stability has allowed for these chameleons to diverge genetically and phenotypically.

"Food quality and safety have been a significant and pressing issue in recent years. In light of the FAO's definition of food security the physical, social and economic access to sufficient and nutritious food - food safety plays a fundamental role. Animal feed and feeding is pivotal to the livestock industry, but the use of veterinary antibiotics (VAs) and synthetic growth promoters (SGP) diminishes the sustainability of the diets and. can cause an accumulation of residues in animals (meat, milk and eggs) and the environment (water and soil pollution). Wastewater systems are another major pathway through which antibiotics and hormones can enter the environment, with negative consequences. In order to protect the planet through more sustainable feeding, the reduction of antibiotics and synthetic growth promoters is a key aim, in particular with the goal of reducing antibiotic resistance and allergies. Analytical methods play a crucial role in food analysis, to determine the presence of antibiotics and other additives. Recent methods are based on liquid chromatography with ultraviolet, fluorescence, or mass spectrophotometry detection, which is recognized as an essential technique in food analysis, able to identify more than 300 compounds in feed samples. In general, a monitoring program put in place to educate the population on the hazards of residues in animal products is necessary, in conjunction with a continuous decrease in the use of antibiotics and synthetic growth promoters in animal diets.

"The impact of intercultural workplace relationships on local employees has been scarcely investigated in hospitality. This paper adopts the contact hypothesis perspective in order to explore the ways in which intercultural encounters between foreign and local hospitality employees influence the latter, in sociocultural and organizational terms. A conceptual model is developed, tested within the Cypriot hospitality industry, and analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings support the contact hypothesis, in that prior attitudes towards the ethnically different other influence the development of intercultural workplace relationships, which in turn influence local employees' wider attitudes towards foreigners. Furthermore, the importance of fair treatment and respect at work are stressed, as they mediate the relationship between intercultural workplace relationships and affective commitment.

"As family structures diversify, attitudes towards nontraditional families (e.g., same-sex-parent and cross-race families) appear to be becoming more favorable. Despite more favorable attitudes, we propose that explicitly and implicitly people view nontraditional families as less family-like than traditional (i.e., heterosexual, same-race) families. We also propose that people will hold the behavior of nontraditional (vs. traditional) families to higher standards. In Study 1, participants explicitly rated nontraditional (vs. traditional) family photos as less family-like and as less loving. In Study 2, using a reaction-time measure, participants took longer to correctly categorize nontraditional (vs. traditional) families into the family category, suggesting that at an implicit level people have greater difficulty recognizing nontraditional families as family. In Studies 3 and 4, ambiguous (i.e., positive and negative) behavior licensed more harsh evaluations of a nontraditional familybut did not affect evaluations of a traditional familyrelative to learning only positive family behavior. Despite survey data that suggest that people's views of nontraditional families are becoming more favorable, our evidence indicates that people nonetheless harbor prejudice against certain family structures. Beyond documenting two biases against nontraditional families, this work highlights the need for prejudice researchers to examine meaningful levels of social identity, such as family units, that are intermediate between individuals and broad social classes.

"This study presents control algorithms for a new unified power quality conditioner (UPQC) without the series transformers that are frequently used to make the insertion of the series converter of the UPQC between the power supply and the load. The behaviour of the proposed UPQC is evaluated in presence of voltage imbalances, as well as under non-sinusoidal voltage-and current conditions. The presented algorithms derive from the concepts involving the active and non-active currents, together with a phase-locked-loop circuit. Based on these real-time algorithms, and considering the proposed hardware topology, the UPQC is able to compensate the harmonic components of the voltages and currents, correct the power factor, and keep the load voltages regulated, all of this in a dynamic way, responding instantaneously to changes in the loads or in the electrical power system. The control algorithms were distributed in a two-DSP digital control architecture, without any communication between them. Consequently, can be increased the sampling frequency of the acquired voltages and currents and improve the UPQC performance. Furthermore, some constraints of the proposed UPQC are evidenced, particularly when the main voltages are imbalanced. Simulation and experimental results are presented to verify the UPQC performance under transient and steady state conditions.

"For the characteristic of compact structure, low inertia, high rigidness and accuracy, parallel mechanisms are worthwhile to be popularized in the field of agricultural robotization, especially in situations that require precise movement in limited space. Focusing on the harvesting task of strawberries in ridge culture, a 4-PPPR robot manipulator with three translational DOF and one rotational DOF is devised in this paper. A type synthesis method of G(F) set theory is used to design its topology structure in 3D space. Compared to traditional machine design methods, this synthesis method allow one to decide the manipulator's configuration in a Topdown logic initially from the appointed features of the manipulator's moving platform. A software simulation is carried out to demonstrate this mechanism can meet all the movement requirements by driving the four active joints allocated on the fixed platform.

"We present a frame-invariant method for detecting coherent structures from Lagrangian flow trajectories that can he sparse in number, as is the case in many fluid mechanics applications of practical interest. 'The method, based on principles used in graph colouring and spectral graph drawing algorithms, examines a measure of the kinematic dissimilarity of all pairs of fluid trajectories, measured either experimentally, e.g. using particle tracking velocimetry, or numerically, by advecting fluid particles in the Eulerian velocity field. Coherence is assigned to groups of particles whose kinematics remain similar throughout the time interval for which trajectory data are available, regardless of their physical proximity to one another. Through the use of several analytical and experimental validation cases, this algorithm is shown to robustly detect coherent structures using significantly less flow data than are required by existing spectral graph theory methods.

"Tuberculosis (TB) remains among the most deadly diseases in the world. The only available vaccine against tuberculosis is the bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine, which does not ensure full protection in adults. There is a global urgency for the development of an effective vaccine for preventing disease transmission, and it requires novel approaches. We are exploring the use of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as a vector for antigen delivery to mucosal sites. Here, we demonstrate the successful expression and surface display of a Mycobacterium tuberculosis fusion antigen (comprising Ag85B and ESAT-6, referred to as AgE6) on Lactobacillus plantarum. The AgE6 fusion antigen was targeted to the bacterial surface using two different anchors, a lipoprotein anchor directing the protein to the cell membrane and a covalent cell wall anchor. AgE6-producing L. plantarum strains using each of the two anchors induced antigen-specific proliferative responses in lymphocytes purified from TB-positive donors. Similarly, both strains induced immune responses in mice after nasal or oral immunization. The impact of the anchoring strategies was reflected in dissimilarities in the immune responses generated by the two L. plantarum strains in vivo. The present study comprises an initial step toward the development of L. plantarum as a vector for M. tuberculosis antigen delivery. IMPORTANCE This work presents the development of Lactobacillus plantarum as a candidate mucosal vaccine against tuberculosis. Tuberculosis remains one of the top infectious diseases worldwide, and the only available vaccine, bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), fails to protect adults and adolescents. Direct antigen delivery to mucosal sites is a promising strategy in tuberculosis vaccine development, and lactic acid bacteria potentially provide easy, safe, and low-cost delivery vehicles for mucosal immunization. We have engineered L. plantarum strains to produce a Mycobacterium tuberculosis fusion antigen and to anchor this antigen to the bacterial cell wall or to the cell membrane. The recombinant strains elicited proliferative antigenspecific T-cell responses in white blood cells from tuberculosis-positive humans and induced specific immune responses after nasal and oral administrations in mice.

"Inter-basin water transfer projects might cause complex hydro-chemical and biological variation in the receiving aquatic ecosystems. Whether machine learning models can be used to predict changes in phytoplankton community composition caused by water transfer projects have rarely been studied. In the present study, we used machine learning models to predict the total algal cell densities and changes in phytoplankton community composition in Miyun reservoir caused by the middle route of the South to-North Water Transfer Project (SNWTP). The model performances of four machine learning models, including regression trees (RT), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN) were evaluated and the best model was selected for further prediction. The results showed that the predictive accuracies (Pearson's correlation coefficient) of the models were RF (0.974), ANN (0.951), SVM (0.860), and RT (0.817) in the training step and RF (0.806), ANN (0.734), SVM (0.730), and RT (0.692) in the testing step. Therefore, the RF model was the best method for estimating total algal cell densities. Furthermore, the predicted accuracies of the RF model for dominant phytoplankton phyla (Cyanophyta, Chlorophyta, and Bacillariophyta) in Miyun reservoir ranged from 0.824 to 0.869 in the testing step. The predicted proportions with water transfer of the different phytoplankton phyla ranged from -8.88% to 9.93%, and the predicted dominant phyla with water transfer in each season remained unchanged compared to the phytoplankton succession without water transfer. The results of the present study provide a useful tool for predicting the changes in phytoplankton community caused by water transfer. The method is transferrable to other locations via establishment of models with relevant data to a particular area. Our findings help better understanding the possible changes in aquatic ecosystems influenced by inter-basin water transfer. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"This pilot study investigated the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an Internet Support Group (ISG) for parents of children with NF1. Eligible parents were recruited by email and completed baseline questionnaires assessing social support, self-efficacy, depression, and anxiety. The ISG involved eight weekly 90-min chat sessions and a discussion forum open 24 h/day for 8 weeks. Follow-up measures were completed immediately post-intervention and 3 months later. Parents from 33 families (29 mothers, 4 fathers) completed baseline measures. Over half of parents (52 %) rated their child's disease severity as mild, 33 % moderate, and 15 % severe. Among 21 parents who completed post-intervention measures, ratings of perceived emotional (p = .0008) and informational (p = .0003) support increased. There were no significant changes in self-efficacy, depression, or anxiety (ps >.05). The mean satisfaction rating was moderately high (7.6/10; range 4-10). Some parents commented that the chat sessions were at inconvenient times, which may have limited participation. Preliminary evidence in this small sample of parents suggests that ISGs may be a feasible and potentially efficacious method of providing support to parents of children with NF1. Having multiple weekly chat sessions held at various days and times may improve accessibility and participation. Clinicians are encouraged to help parents access online support resources.

"The rise and fall of artificial neural networks is well documented in the scientific literature of both computer science and computational chemistry. Yet almost two decades later, we are now seeing a resurgence of interest in deep learning, a machine learning algorithm based on multilayer neural networks. Within the last few years, we have seen the transformative impact of deep learning in many domains, particularly in speech recognition and computer vision, to the extent that the majority of expert practitioners in those field are now regularly eschewing prior established models in favor of deep learning models. In this review, we provide an introductory overview into the theory of deep neural networks and their unique properties that distinguish them from traditional machine learning algorithms used in cheminformatics. By providing an overview of the variety of emerging applications of deep neural networks, we highlight its ubiquity and broad applicability to a wide range of challenges in the field, including quantitative structure activity relationship, virtual screening, protein structure prediction, quantum chemistry, materials design, and property prediction. In reviewing the performance of deep neural networks, we observed a consistent outperformance against non-neural networks state-of-the-art models across disparate research topics, and deep neural network-based models often exceeded the glass ceiling expectations of their respective tasks. Coupled with the maturity of GPU-accelerated computing for training deep neural networks and the exponential growth of chemical data on which to train these networks on, we anticipate that deep learning algorithms will be a valuable tool for computational chemistry.

In this paper we classify initial conditions of trajectories evolving in incompressible vector fields according to the character of motion of material around the trajectory. In particular, we provide calculations that can be used to determine the number of expanding directions and the presence of rotation from the characteristic polynomial of the Jacobian matrix of mesochronic velocity. In doing so, we show that (a) the mesochronic velocity can be used to characterize dynamical deformation of three-dimensional volumes, (b) the resulting mesochronic analysis is a finite-time extension of the Okubo-Weiss-Chong analysis of incompressible velocity fields, (c) the two-dimensional mesochronic analysis from Mezic et al. A New Mixing Diagnostic and Gulf Oil Spill Movement, Science 330, (2010), 486-489, extends to three-dimensional state spaces. Theoretical considerations are further supported by numerical computations performed for a dynamical system arising in fluid mechanics, the unsteady Arnold{Beltrami{Childress (ABC) flow.

"Advanced modern processors support single instruction, multiple data instructions (e.g., Intel-AVX and ARM-NEON) and a massive body of research on vector-parallel implementations of modular arithmetic, which are crucial components for modern public-key cryptography ranging from Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (RSA), ElGamal, Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA), and elliptic curve cryptography, have been conducted. In this paper, we introduce a novel double operand scanning method to speed up multi-precision squaring with non-redundant representations on single instruction, multiple data architecture where the part of the operands are doubled to compute the squaring operation without read-after-write dependencies between source and destination variables. Afterwards, Karatsuba algorithm is applied to both multiplication and squaring operations. For modular multiplication, separated Montgomery algorithm is chosen. Finally, the Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (RSA) implementations outperform the best-known results on the ARM-NEON platforms. Copyright (C) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

"Experimental self-driving cars are being tested on public roads, and will at some point be commercially sold or made otherwise available to the public. A self-driving car and its digital control systems take over control tasks previously performed by the human driver. This places high demands on this control system which has to perform the highly complex task of driving the car through traffic. When this system does not perform its task adequately and damage ensues the failure of the control system may be used as a stepping stone to claim liability of the manufacturer of the car or the control system. Uncertainties about the application of (product) liability law may slow down the uptake of self-driving cars more than is warranted on the basis of technical progress. This article examines how the decision about the timing of a market introduction can be approached and how possible chilling effects of liability law can be redressed with an adequate system of obligatory insurance.

"The aim of this study is to compare the prevalence of cardiovascular (CVD)-related comorbidities in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) or psoriasis (Ps) in UK primary care against matched cohorts. Matched retrospective cohort study used a primary care consultation database. Three cohorts were constructed using all patients with a Read code diagnosis of AS, PsA or Ps between 1999 and 2009; each cohort was then compared in a 1:4 ratio to a matched cohort. The prevalence of CVD-related comorbidities (hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, hyperlipidaemia and diabetes mellitus) were identified by the first consultation of a comorbid Read code, in those with an inflammatory condition of interest. The prevalence of CVD-related comorbidities was compared between each inflammatory cohort and their matched cohort using Fisher's exact test. Ninety-four AS, 106 PsA and 290 Ps patients were identified. Compared with matched cohorts, the most prevalent CVD-related comorbidity in patients with AS was hypertension (35 (37.2 %) vs. 96 matched (25.5 %), p = 0.03); this was also the case for PsA (41 (38.7 %) vs. 114 matched (26.9 %), p = 0.02). No differences were seen in the prevalence of other CVD-related comorbidities in those with AS, PsA or Ps compared to their matched cohorts. Our findings provide UK comparisons of CVD-related comorbidities in patients with AS, PsA and Ps alone; specifically, demonstrating increased prevalence of hypertension in AS and PsA cohorts compared to their matched cohorts. This further supports the argument for more evidence in the need for screening and intervention around CVD comorbidities in inflammatory conditions.

"BACKGROUND: The prescribing pattern of epinephrine over time is an indicator of the secular trend of anaphylaxis. However, it is not well known in a population level in the United States. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the trend of prescriptions for epinephrine autoinjectors in Olmsted County, Minn, residents. METHODS: Outpatient prescriptions for epinephrine were identified among residents of Olmsted County, Minn, between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2010. We used the first prescription per patient per year, and the first prescription per patient during the study period to calculate incidence rates. Incidence rates per 100,000 person-years were calculated using patients prescribed epinephrine per year as the numerator and age-and sex-specific counts of the population of Olmsted County as the denominator. The relationships of age group, sex, and year of prescription with incidence rates were assessed by fitting Poisson regression models using the SAS procedure GENMOD. RESULTS: The overall incidence rate of epinephrine autoinjector prescriptions during the study period was 757 per 100,000 person-years (95% confidence interval: 740-774). The prescription rates per patient per year increased over time, with an annual rate of increase of 8% (P < .001), but the rates per patient remained stable (P = .077). For each year, incidence rates overall were higher in women compared with men (P < .001). From ages 0 to 19, incidence rates were higher in boys compared with girls. At age 20 and above, incidence rates were higher in women compared with men. CONCLUSIONS: The overall rate of epinephrine autoinjector prescriptions increased, but the rate of first-time prescriptions was stable from 2005 to 2010. In childhood, boys were more likely to receive a prescription than girls, but this reversed in later ages. (C) 2016 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology

"Sediment microbial fuel cells (SMFCs) are expected to be used as a renewable power source for remote environmental monitoring; therefore, evaluation of their long-term power performance is critical for their usability. In' this paper, we present novel data needed to understand the long-term performance of SMFCs. We used 3-D Microemulsion (3DMe)(TM) doped anodes, which slowly release lactate and its fermented products. During our tests, anode-limited SMFCs with and without 3DMe-doped anodes were operated for more than 18 months with a load simulating a sensor operation. We found that dclping an anode with an electron donor reduced startup time and increased maximum power (55 +/- 2 mu W compared to 46 +/- 2 mu W) in the control systems. We found that the long-term steady power performance is approximately 33% of the maximum power (similar to 18 LW). Finally, our small-sized SMFCs generated higher power densities than those in the literature (28 mW/m(2) versus 4 mW/m2). Using electron donor doped anodes can be practical when a short startup time and initial high power are needed. However, if long-term power is critical, the addition of an electron donor does not provide a practical advantage. In addition, in long-term operation enrichment of the anode surface with electrochemically active bacteria does not provide any advantage. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"HMGCS2 (mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-COA synthase 2) is a control enzyme in ketogenesis. The mitochondrial localization and interaction with APP (beta-amyloid precursor protein) suggest that HMGCS2 may play a role in the pathophysiology of AD (Alzheimer's disease). Here we report that overexpression of HMGCS2 decreased levels of APP and related CTFs (carboxy-terminal fragments), which was largely prevented by an autophagic inhibitor chloroquine. In addition, HMGCS2 enhancement of autophagic marker LC3II was diminished by rapamycin, an inhibitor of mechanistic target of rapamycin. Moreover, deprivation of EBSS (Earle's Balanced Salt Solution) significantly augmented the effect of HMGCS2 on LC3II, while acetoacetate reversed the reduction of LC3II, APP and CTFs which was induced by HMGCS2 knockdown. In the presence of acetoacetate, rapamycin failed to induce further increase of LC3IL which mimicked the effect of HMGCS2 overexpression. Finally, HMGCS2 enhanced the antioxidant response. Collectively, HMGCS2 shares with ketone bodies common features in autophagic clearance of APP and CTFs, suggesting that ketone bodies play an important role in HMGCS2 regulation of the autophagy.

"Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) is an enabling technology which provides coating and material features with significant advantages compared to other existing techniques for depositing precise nanometer-thin two-dimensional (2D) nanostructures. It is a cyclic process which relies on sequential self-terminating reactions between gas phase precursor molecules and a solid surface. ALD is especially advantageous when the film quality or thickness is critical, offering ultra-high aspect ratios. ALD provides digital thickness control to the atomic level by depositing film one atomic layer at a time, as well as pinhole-free films even over a very large and complex areas. Digital control extends to sandwiches, hetero-structures, nano-laminates, metal oxides, graded index layers and doping, and it is perfect for conformal coating and challenging 2D electrodes for various functional devices. The technique's capabilities are presented on the example of ALD-developed ultra-thin 2D tungsten oxide (W0(3)) over the large area of standard 4 Si substrates. The discussed advantages of ALD enable and endorse the employment of this technique for the development of hetero-nanostructure 2D semiconductors with unique properties. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"Exoskeleton robots are categorized as rehabilitating and assisting robots which could be applied in other applications such as power augmentation systems, haptic systems, and virtual reality. Considering the increasing number of old people and those who suffer from physical weakness and some kinds of disabilities, the need of exploiting the rehabilitation mechanisms and processes is one of the most important issues in this field. In this paper a simple upper limb exoskeleton with one degree of freedom is studied and developed. The joint torque estimation corresponding to the biological movements as well as safety issues are considered. Kinematic parameters of the upper limb are needed to design the robot, thus a mechanism is designed to derive this set of data. Then a prototype of the exoskeleton is introduced, whose mechanical design, actuation and power transmission method as well as its selection criteria are discussed here. The mechanical design section is followed by electrical circuits and devices. Finally, the performance of robot is evaluated using a test-rig mechanism which examines how the kinematical parameters of arm could be tracked by our approach.

"Restoring hydrologic connectivity between channels and floodplains is common practice in stream and river restoration. Floodplain hydrology and hydrogeology impact stream hydraulics, ecology, biogeochemical processing, and pollutant removal, yet rigorous field evaluations of surface water-groundwater exchange within floodplains during overbank floods are rare. We conducted five sets of experimental floods to mimic floodplain reconnection by pumping stream water onto an existing floodplain swale. Floods were conducted throughout the year to capture seasonal variation and each involved two replicate floods on successive days to test the effect of varying antecedent moisture. Water levels and specific conductance were measured in surface water, soil, and groundwater within the floodplain, along with surface flow into and out of the floodplain. Vegetation density varied seasonally and controlled the volume of surface water storage on the floodplain. By contrast, antecedent moisture conditions controlled storage of water in floodplain soils, with drier antecedent moisture conditions leading to increased subsurface storage and slower flood wave propagation across the floodplain surface. The site experienced spatial heterogeneity in vertical connectivity between surface water and groundwater across the floodplain surface, where propagation of hydrostatic pressure, preferential flow, and bulk Darcy flow were all mechanisms that may have occurred during the five floods. Vertical connectivity also increased with time, suggesting higher frequency of floodplain inundation may increase surface water-groundwater exchange across the floodplain surface. Understanding the variability of floodplain impacts on water quality noted in the literature likely requires better accounting for seasonal variations in floodplain vegetation and antecedent moisture as well as heterogeneous exchange flow mechanisms.

"This paper presents a neural network-based vision inspection system interfaced with a robot to detect and report IC lead defects on-line. The vision system consists of custom software that contains a neural network database for each of the ICs to be inspected on a PCB. The vision system uses gray scale images and a single layer neural network with three outputs based on defect criteria. Each IC has a different inspection area, thus, the input vector varies for each of the ICs. The IC networks were trained with Matlab's Bayesian regularization module. Performance of each of the networks investigated was found to be 100%, based on the defect criteria. This system has been implemented and tested on several electronic products using ProE, C++ and OpenGL software platforms [R. Balderas, S.

"Available cholinergic drugs for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) provide modest symptomatic benefit. We hypothesized that co-administration of a peripheral anticholinergic to reduce dose-limiting adverse effects (AEs) would enable the safe/tolerable use of higher cholinesterase inhibitor doses and thus improve their antidementia efficacy. A modified single-blind, ascending-dose, phase IIa study of donepezil plus solifenacin (CPC-201) lasting 26 weeks was conducted in 41 patients with probable AD of moderate severity. Entry criteria included the use of donepezil at a dose of 10 mg/day during the preceding 3 months. The primary outcome measure was the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of donepezil achieved (to protocol limit of 40 mg/day) when administered with the anticholinergic solifenacin 15 mg/day. Secondary measures included assessments of cognitive and global function, as well as of AEs. The mean +/- SD donepezil MTD increased to 38 +/- 0.74 mg/day (median 40 mg/day; p < 0.001); 88% of the study population safely attained this dose at the end of titration. Markedly reduced donepezil AE frequency, especially gastrointestinal, allowed this dose increase. There were no drug-related serious AEs or clinically significant laboratory abnormalities. At 26 weeks, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Component scores in the efficacy evaluable population improved by 0.35 +/- 0.85 points over baseline (p < 0.05), an estimated 2.5 +/- 0.84 points above 10 mg/day donepezil and 5.4 +/- 0.84 points above historic placebo (both p < 0.05). Clinical Global Impression of Improvement scores improved by 0.94 +/- 0.20 to 3.1 +/- 0.20 points (p < 0.001). The findings suggest that limiting donepezil AEs by co-administration of solifenacin allows the safe administration of substantially higher cholinesterase inhibitors doses that may augment cognitive and global benefits in patients with AD.

"Treatment of cancer patients involves a multidisciplinary approach including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Traditionally, patients with metastatic disease are treated with combination chemotherapies or targeted agents. These cytotoxic agents have good response rates and achieve palliation; however, complete responses are rarely seen. The field of cancer immunology has made rapid advances in the past 20 years. Recently, a number of agents and vaccines, which modulate the immune system to allow it to detect and target cancer cells, are being developed. The benefit of these agents is twofold, it enhances the ability the body's own immune system to fight cancer, thus has a lower incidence of side effects compared to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy. Secondly, a small but substantial number of patients with metastatic disease are cured by immunotherapy or achieve durable responses lasting for a number of years. In this article, we review the FDA-approved immunotherapy agents in the field of genitourinary malignancies. We also summarize new immunotherapy agents being evaluated in clinical studies either as single agents or as a combination.

"Despite via-ferrata (Klettersteig) climbing has become more and more popular, currently no appropriate safety equipment is available for lightweight climbers. A typical example of missing user friendliness for children is the via ferrata carabiner whose dimension compared to customary adult equipment - and unlocking procedure might be inadequate for a child's hand. A new designed effort saving via-ferrata carabiner (ERGOTEC, SALEWA Sportgerate GmbH, Germany) has been evaluated with respect to ergonomics and user friendliness for both children and adults. Twelve adults (21 to 29 years) and twelve children and adolescents (7 to 15 years) tested a new effort saving via-ferrata carabiner ERGOTEC and two conventional carabiners - One-Touch (EDELRID GmbH & Co. KG, Germany) and ATTAC (SALEWA Sportgerate GmbH, Germany). The activities produced by the flexors M. brachioradialis and M. flexor carpi ulnaris were measured in two loading situations by using Electromyography (EMG, Noraxon Inc., USA). With the new effort saving via-ferrata carabiner a reduction of muscle activity compared to the two conventional carabiners was observed for adults as well as for children and adolescents. However due to different hand anthropometry and muscle forces differences in operation and handling of the via-ferrata carabiners, i.e. the position of the transmission of the finger forces, were observed. To compensate the lower finger forces children use the advantage of a better lever arm for all three tested carabiners, i.e. the distance of the force transmission to the hinge joint increased. But with this position of the fingers it is difficult to mount the customary carabiners in the steel cable. With the design of the via-ferrata carabiner ERGOTEC a user friendly handling was observed also with the anthropometry of smaller child hands. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"Sediment concentration is fundamental for determining sediment transport in open channels. The Rouse equation, one of several methods for computing sediment concentration, has been derived using deterministic hydraulic principles. This study derives the Rouse equation using the Shannon entropy theory. The derivation requires a hypothesis on the cumulative probability distribution function of sediment concentration in terms of flow depth which is formulated in a general form and can specialize in several specific forms reported in the literature. The advantage of using the entropy theory is that it permits quantification of uncertainty associated with concentration and determination of parameters in terms of specified information, such as mean concentration.

"Although intelligence should theoretically evolve to help animals solve specific types of problems posed by the environment, it is unclear which environmental challenges favour enhanced cognition, or how general intelligence evolves along with domain-specific cognitive abilities. The social intelligence hypothesis posits that big brains and great intelligence have evolved to cope with the labile behaviour of group mates. We have exploited the remarkable convergence in social complexity between cercopithecine primates and spotted hyaenas to test predictions of the social intelligence hypothesis in regard to both cognition and brain size. Behavioural data indicate that there has been considerable convergence between primates and hyaenas with respect to their social cognitive abilities. Moreover, compared with other hyaena species, spotted hyaenas have larger brains and expanded frontal cortex, as predicted by the social intelligence hypothesis. However, broader comparative study suggests that domain-general intelligence in carnivores probably did not evolve in response to selection pressures imposed specifically in the social domain. The cognitive buffer hypothesis, which suggests that general intelligence evolves to help animals cope with novel or changing environments, appears to offer a more robust explanation for general intelligence in carnivores than any hypothesis invoking selection pressures imposed strictly by sociality or foraging demands.

"This paper proposes a light-weight online classification method to detect smarthpone user's postural actions, such as sitting, standing, walking, and running. These actions are named as user states since they are inferred after the analysis of data acquired from the smartphones equipped accelerometer sensors. To differentiate one user state from another, many studies can be found in the literature. However, this study differs from all others by offering a computational lightweight and online classification method without knowing any priori information. Moreover, the proposed method not only provides a standalone solution in differentiation of user states, but also it assists other widely used offline supervised classification methods by automatically generating training data classes and/or input system matrices. Furthermore, we improve these existing methods for the purpose of online processing by reducing the required computational burden. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method makes a solid differentiation in user states even when the sensor is being operated under slower sampling frequencies.

"Cocaine addiction is characterized by alterations in motivational and cognitive processes. Recent studies have shown that some alterations present in cocaine users may be related to the activity of large functional networks. The aim of this study was to investigate how these functional networks are modulated by non-drug rewarding stimuli in cocaine-dependent individuals. Twenty abstinent cocaine-dependent and 21 healthy matched male controls viewed erotic and neutral pictures while undergoing a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. Group independent component analysis was then performed in order to investigate how functional networks were modulated by reward in cocaine addicts. The results showed that cocaine addicts, compared with healthy controls, displayed diminished modulation of the left frontoparietal network in response to erotic pictures, specifically when they were unpredicted. Additionally, a positive correlation between the length of cocaine abstinence and the modulation of the left frontoparietal network by unpredicted erotic images was found. In agreement with current addiction models, our results suggest that cocaine addiction contributes to reduce sensitivity to rewarding stimuli and that abstinence may mitigate this effect.

"Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) is a reproductive toxicant in male rodents. The aim of the current study was to extrapolate the pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics of mono(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (MEHP, a primary metabolite of DEHP) in humans by using data from oral administration of DEHP to chimeric mice transplanted with human hepatocytes. MEHP and its glucuronide were detected in plasma from control mice and chimeric mice after single oral doses of 250 mg DEHP/kg body weight. Biphasic plasma concentration time curves of MEHP and its glucuronide were seen only in control mice. MEHP and its glucuronide were extensively excreted in urine within 24h in mice with humanized liver. In contrast, fecal excretion levels of MEHP glucuronide were high in control mice compared with those with humanized liver. Adjusted animal biomonitoring equivalents from chimeric mice studies were scaled to human biomonitoring equivalents using known species allometric scaling factors and in vitro metabolic clearance data with a simple physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model. Estimated urine MEHP concentrations in humans were consistent with reported concentrations. This research illustrates how chimeric mice transplanted with human hepatocytes in combination with a simple PBPK model can assist evaluations of pharmacokinetics or toxicokinetics of the primary or secondary metabolites of DEHP.

"Leaf mass per area (LMA) is a primary plant functional trait that represents the cost of constructing a leaf. Ultimately, plants modify LMA by altering leaf thickness (LT), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), or both. While LMA can be modified through both of these constituents, studies of LMA have found that there is variation in whether LT or LDMC changes are responsible for LMA-and the relationships change depending on the species or functional groups being compared. In this study, we used a phylogenetic framework to determine that evolutionary shifts in LMA are driven by LT, and not LDMC, among 45 Serengeti grass species. We considered two alternative hypotheses that could result in evolutionary correlation of LMA on LT but not LDMC: either (1) LT is more labile than LDMC-and is therefore a less costly means to change LMA or (2) LDMC is tightly coupled to a different dimension of leaf variation (e.g., leaf hydraulics), leaving LT as the source of variation in LMA. LT was not more labile than LDMC, leading us to conclude that the evolution of LMA has been shaped by LT because LDMC is responding to other demands on leaf physiology. We speculate that leaf hydraulics provide this constraint on LDMC. The decoupling of LDMC from LT may allow plants to better optimize resource allocation in ecosystems where gradients in light competition, herbivory, and aridity place competing demands on leaf economics.

"Introduction. Ankylosing spondylitis (AS)/Morbus Bechterew is a chronic inflammatory rheumatoid disease. The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction is involved in 4-35% of AS cases, and is correlated to the severity and extension of AS. Even though AS-caused TMJ ankylosis is exceptional, one should have high index of suspicion of TMJ ankylosis in AS for an early detection, because it is an extremely serious and disabling condition that causes problems with mastication, swallowing, digestion, speech, appearance and poor oral hygiene with heavy caries. Case report. A 54-year-old male patient sought medical attention at the Department of Periodontology and Oral Medicine, Clinic for Dentistry at the Military Medical Academy, Belgrade, Serbia, with the chief complaint of pain in the area of the upper left canine in the presence of limited mouth opening. The treatment plan consisted of upper left canine management and rehabilitation of the remaining teeth in the frontal and the premolar region in both, the upper and lower jaw. Even though molar region needed to be treated, unfortunately it was not in the treatment plan because ankylosis of TMJ made the treatment impossible. Conclusion. The patients with AS-caused TMJ ankylosis are considered a diagnostic challenge to routine dentistry. Accent should be given to early diagnosis and multidisciplinary approach in the treatment of the AS patients towards the favorable disease course and outcome.

"Background: Cervical cancer is a common gynecologic malignant tumor and has a great impact on women's health. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is implicated in cervical cancer and precancerous lesions and the two are possibly two stages of disease progression. With the technological development of molecular biology and epidemiology, detection and treatment of HPV has become an important means to prevent cervical cancer. Methods: Here we present a novel, rapid, sensitive and specific isothermal method of recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), which is established to detect the two most common high-risk human papillomavirus type 16 and type 18 DNA. In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of the RPA assay, incubating clinical specimens of HPV16 and HPV18 using plasmids standard. It operates at constant low temperature without the thermal instrumentation for incubation. The products can be detected via agarose gel electrophoresis assay, reverse dot blot assay, and quantitative real-time assay with SYBR Green I. We assess the diagnostic performance of the RPA assay for detecting of HPV16 and HPV18 in 335 clinical samples from patients suspected of cervical cancer. Results: The results revealed no cross-reaction with other HPV genotypes and the RPA assay achieve a sensitivity of 10(0) copies. Compared with TaqMan qPCR, the RPA technique achieves exponential amplification with no need for pretreatment of sample DNA at 37 degrees C for 20 minutes, which reveals more satisfactory performance. The agreement between the RPA and qPCR assays was 97.6% (kappa = 0.89) for HPV16 positivity and 98.5% (kappa = 0.81) for HPV18 positivity, indicating very good correlation between both tests. Conclusions: Importantly, the RPA assay was demonstrated to be a useful and powerful method for detection of HPV virus, which therefore may serve as a valuable tool for rapid diagnosis of HPV infection in both commercial and clinical applications.

"McEliece and Goldreich-Goldwasser-Halevi (GGH) cryptosystems are two instances of code and lattice-based cryptosystems whose security are based on the hardness of coding theoretic and lattice problems, respectively. However, such cryptosystems have a number of drawbacks which make them inefficient in practice. On the other hand, low density lattice codes (LDLCs) are practical lattice codes which can achieve capacity over additive white Gaussian noise channel and also can be encoded and decoded efficiently. This paper introduces a public key cryptosystem based on Latin square LDLCs, by which a relationship can be attained between code and lattice-based cryptography. In this way, we can exploit the efficient properties of codes and lattices, simultaneously to improve the security and efficiency of the proposed scheme. For instance, the security of this scheme is based on the hard problems related to lattices, i.e., closest vector problem and shortest basis problem, which in turn lead to increase the security level. On the other hand, we exploit the low complexity decoding algorithm of LDLCs to reduce the computational complexity. Moreover, this property allows using the larger values of the codeword length. Also, we use the special Gaussian vector, whose variance is upper bounded by Poltyrev bound, as the perturbation (error) vector. These strategies make the proposed scheme to be secure against the conventional cryptanalytic attacks.

"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a most serious age-related neurodegenerative disorder accompanied with significant memory impairments in this world. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to be invlolved in the pathophysiology of AD. Previous studies have shown that miRNA-206 (miR-206) is implicated in the pathogenesis of AD via suppressing the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the brain. Here, we examined the miR-206-3p and miR-206-5p expression in the hippocampus and cortex of Abeta precursor protein (APP)/presenilin-1 (PS1) transgenic mice treated with donepezil, a drug approved for treating AD in clinic. We found that the expression of miR-206-3p was significantly up-regulated in the hippocampus and cortex of APP/PS1 mice, while donepezil administration significantly reversed this dysfunction. In addition, enhancing the miR-206-3p level by the usage of AgomiR-206-3p significantly attenuated the anti-dementia effects of donepezil in APP/PS1 mice. Together, these results suggested that miR-206-3p is involved in the anti-dementia effects of donepezil, and could be a novel pharmacological target for treating AD.

"Digital Active EMI Filtering (DAEF) technique is a new direction of conductive EMI suppression technologies for switched-mode power converters. However, the conventional DAEF topology only suppresses EMI to ground on the AC (or DC) ports. It doesn't definitely aim to Common Mode (CM) or Differential Mode (DM) EMI. In this paper, a novel DAEF topology is proposed. It can flexibly suppress CM and DM EMI, and also effectively adjust EMI suppression ability as well as prevent interconversion between CM and DM EMI. On the other hand, because of the parasitic parameters of circuit and the time delay of controlling system, the traditional model of DAEF cannot describe the system behavior accurately. This paper proposes a precise model of DAEF system. The model not only considers the passive device parasitic parameters of sense circuit, injection circuit and decoupling circuit, but also considers the time delay of the digital control system. This model can accurately describe filter performance of DAEF. Finally, simulation and experimental results show that the proposed DAEF effectively suppress CM EMI. Moreover, the precise model can predict the system filter performance accurately.

"The imaging spectrometers of the second orbiting carbon observatory were radiometrically calibrated before launch during instrumentlevel ground testing. The gain and dark responses were characterized for each focal plane array detector element. An integrating sphere source with an integrated monitoring spectroradiometer illuminated the OCO-2 spectrometers at many light levels. Instrument output was compared with the calibrated output of the source to derive gain coefficients. This source was calibrated in situ with respect to the National Institute of Standards and Technology reference standards, and the instrument met its absolute performance requirement of 5%. Matching fields of view for the internal monitor detectors and the external instrument under test was found to be particularly important, as observed in the results and supported by modeling. Temperature-dependent dark offsets were corrected in a separate process. Solar spectra with varying neutral density filters were used to validate the linearity of the spectrometers.

"One triumph of the human mind is the ability to place the multitudinous array of people we encounter into in-and out-group members based on racial characteristics. One fundamental question that remains to be answered is whether invisible own- and other-race faces can nevertheless influence subsequent affective judgments. Here, we employed continuous flash suppression (CFS) to render own- and other-race faces unperceivable in an affective priming task. Both on-line and off-line awareness checks were employed to provide more stringent control of partial awareness. Results revealed that relative to own-race faces, imperceptible other-race faces significantly facilitated participants' identification of negative words, suggesting an other-race derogation bias. When faces were presented consciously, we found that not only other-race faces facilitated detection of negative words, but also own-race faces facilitated detection of positive words. These findings together provide novel and strong evidence suggesting that invisible racial faces can bias affective responses. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Few genes such as leptin, leptin receptor encoded by the db (diabetes), pro-opiomelanocortin, AgRP and NPY and melanocortin-4 receptors and insulin-induced gene 2 were linked to obesity. MicroRNAs control gene expression via mRNA degradation and protein translation inhibition and influence cell differentiation, cell growth and cell death. Overexpression of miR-143 inhibits tumour growth by suppressing B cell lymphoma 2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-5 activities and KRAS oncogene. Cancers of the breast, uterus, renal, thyroid and liver are also related to obesity. Any disturbance in the production of sex hormones and insulin, leads to distortion in the balance between cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The possible mechanism linking obesity to cancer involves alteration in the level of adipokines and sex hormones. These mediators act as biomarkers for cancer progression and act as targets for cancer therapy and prevention. Interestingly, many anti-cancerous drugs are also beneficial in treating obesity and vice versa. We also reviewed the possible link in the mechanism of few drugs which act both on cancer and obesity. The present review may be important for molecular biologists, oncologists and clinicians treating cancers and also pave the way for better therapeutic options.

"The mechanisms by which exposure to arsenic induces its myriad pathological effects are undoubtedly complex, while individual susceptibility to their type and severity is likely to be strongly influenced by genetic factors. Human metabolism of arsenic into methylated derivatives, once presumed to result in detoxification, may actually produce species with significantly greater pathological potential. We introduce a transgenic Drosophila model of arsenic methylation, allowing its consequences to be studied in a higher eukaryote exhibiting conservation of many genes and pathways with those of human cells while providing an important opportunity to uncover mechanistic details via the sophisticated genetic analysis for which the system is particularly well suited. The gene for the human enzyme, arsenic (+3 oxidation state) methyltransferase, was introduced into nonmethylating Drosophila under inducible control. Transgenic flies were characterized for enzyme inducibility, production of methylated arsenic species, and the dose-dependent consequences for chromosomal integrity and organismal longevity. Upon enzyme induction, transgenic flies processed arsenite into mono and dimethylated derivatives identical to those found in human urine. When induced flies were exposed to 9 ppm arsenite, chromosomal stability was clearly reduced, whereas at much higher doses, adult life span was significantly increased, a seemingly paradoxical pair of outcomes. Measurement of arsenic body burden in the presence or absence of methylation suggested that enhanced clearance of methylated species might explain this greater longevity under acutely toxic conditions. Our study clearly demonstrates both the hazards and the benefits of arsenic methylation in vivo and suggests a resolution based on evolutionary grounds.

"Big data are widely recognized as being one of the most powerful drivers to promote productivity, improve efficiency, and support innovation. It is highly expected to explore the power of big data and turn big data into big values. To answer the interesting question whether there are inherent correlations between the two tendencies of big data and green challenges, a recent study has investigated the issues on greening the whole life cycle of big data systems. This paper would like to discover the relations between the trend of big data era and that of the new generation green revolution through a comprehensive and panoramic literature survey in big data technologies toward various green objectives and a discussion on relevant challenges and future directions.

"In this work, we demonstrate how an innovative, out-of-cleanroom customized CD/DVD fabrication process can be successfully used for mass production of biosensors with thin-film electrodes. We show that silver and gold electrodes can be used for impedimetric and voltammetric biosensing applications, both in presence and absence of a redox mediator. We modeled the redox/non-redox electrodes impedance through equivalent electrical circuits, and we evaluated their transfer function sensitivity with a one-factor-at-a-time approach. Using this approach, we introduced a new prediction method to find which equivalent electrical circuit elements contribute more to the transfer function variations, then we experimentally validated the predictions measuring the electrodes electrochemical impedance spectroscopy responses with relevant self-assembled monolayer molecules immobilized on them, i.e., MCH and DTSP. We also assess the silver electrodes long-term stability with impedance spectroscopy measurements over a period of 1200 hours, proving their possible use in point-of-care applications. Finally, we also prove that the sensors correctly perform in a practical case, i. e., as a lactic acid biosensor, by studying the optimization of the biosensor efficiency through different enzyme immobilization methods. By comparing lactate oxidase enzyme direct adsorption and covalent binding to DTSP self-assembling monolayers, we found that covalent binding to DTSP can boost the catalytic current of about 40% with respect to that obtained from the direct adsorption of the same enzyme concentration.

"Vocalizations of anuran amphibians have received much attention in studies of behavioral ecology and physiology, but also provide informative characters for identifying and delimiting species. We here review the terminology and variation of frog calls from a perspective of integrative taxonomy, and provide hands-on protocols for recording, analyzing, comparing, interpreting and describing these sounds. Our focus is on advertisement calls, which serve as premating isolation mechanisms and, therefore, convey important taxonomic information. We provide recommendations for terminology of frog vocalizations, with call, note and pulse being the fundamental subunits to be used in descriptions and comparisons. However, due to the complexity and diversity of these signals, an unequivocal application of the terms call and note can be challenging. We therefore provide two coherent concepts that either follow a note-centered approach (defining uninterrupted units of sound as notes, and their entirety as call) or a call-centered approach (defining uninterrupted units as call whenever they are separated by long silent intervals) in terminology. Based on surveys of literature, we show that numerous call traits can be highly variable within and between individuals of one species. Despite idiosyncrasies of species and higher taxa, the duration of calls or notes, pulse rate within notes, and number of pulses per note appear to be more static within individuals and somewhat less affected by temperature. Therefore, these variables might often be preferable as taxonomic characters over call rate or note rate, which are heavily influenced by various factors. Dominant frequency is also comparatively static and only weakly affected by temperature, but depends strongly on body size. As with other taxonomic characters, strong call divergence is typically indicative of species-level differences, whereas call similarities of two populations are no evidence for them being conspecific. Taxonomic conclusions can especially be drawn when the general advertisement call structure of two candidate species is radically different and qualitative call differences are thus observed. On the other hand, quantitative differences in call traits might substantially vary within and among conspecific populations, and require careful evaluation and analysis. We provide guidelines for the taxonomic interpretation of advertisement call differences in sympatric and allopatric situations, and emphasize the need for an integrative use of multiple datasets (bio-acoustics, morphology, genetics), particularly for allopatric scenarios. We show that small-sized frogs often emit calls with frequency components in the ultrasound spectrum, although it is unlikely that these high frequencies are of biological relevance for the majority of them, and we illustrate that detection of upper harmonics depends also on recording distance because higher frequencies are attenuated more strongly. Bioacoustics remains a prime approach in integrative taxonomy of anurans if uncertainty due to possible intraspecific variation and technical artifacts is adequately considered and acknowledged.

"This article explores the relationship between racial prejudice towards blacks and the black-white self-employment rate gap and provides the first direct empirical evidence that racial prejudice negatively impacts black self-employment, particularly in high start-up cost industries. To perform this analysis, I construct a measure of prejudicial attitudes using responses from the General Social Survey and estimate the relationship between self-employment and this index using the American Community Survey. I find that an amount of prejudice equal to the difference in least and most prejudiced census divisions increases the black-white self-employment rate gap in high start-up cost industries by 10.4-16.8%, depending upon whether parental self-employment is controlled for, and represents the entire impact of racial prejudice on the black-white selfemployment rate gap. Additionally, racial prejudice widens the black-white self-employment income gap by between 6.4% and 8.2% in my full specification, dependent upon how income is measured. Evidence indicates that racial prejudice is causing blacks difficulty in financing their businesses. The results presented are robust to various modelling and data assumptions.

"Sex parties are environments where men who have sex with men (MSM) have the opportunity to have sex with multiple partners over a brief period of time. Dim lighting and nonverbal communication are the characteristics of sex parties that make sexual communication more challenging. We report on qualitative data from 47 MSM who attended sex parties in New York City. Participants responded to distinct hypothetical scenarios involving the use of color-coded wristbands to communicate (1) condom use preferences, (2) sexual position (e.g., top, bottom), and (3) human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status at sex parties. The majority had positive-to-neutral attitudes toward color-coded wristbands to indicate (1) condom use preference and (2) sexual position (70.8, 75.0 % HIV positive; 63.6, 81.8 %, HIV negative, respectively). These men cited that wristbands would facilitate the process of pursuing partners with similar interests while also avoiding the discomforts of verbal communication. In contrast, 41.7 % of HIV-positive and 50.0 % of HIV-negative men expressed unfavorable attitudes to using wristbands to communicate HIV status. These men cited the potential for HIV-status discrimination as well as suspicions around dishonest disclosure. Although participants were receptive to utilizing color-coded wristbands at sex parties to convey certain information, it may be unfeasible to use wristbands to communicate HIV status.

"Non-salient permanent magnet machines are considered poor candidates for flux weakening operations due to their inherent low-inductance characteristics. In this paper, a two-pole 24-slot non-salient PM machine design is proposed that can utilize a winding switching technique to achieve wide speed range operation. A very wide speed range operation (from 3 to 1 ratio to as much as 13 to 1) is demonstrated. This is accomplished by simply rearranging the winding coils on the stator periphery. Moreover, a control strategy is proposed that not only utilizes the flux weakening using winding switching, but also flux weakening using a negative d-axis current to maximize the speed range of the machine. The machine is operated with two inverters to control the current in the machine winding over the entire speed range. A dq model for the machine is also presented. Analytical, simulated, and experimental results are provided to validate the proposed machine drive system.

"There remains conflict in the literature about the lateralisation of affective face perception. Some studies have reported a right hemisphere advantage irrespective of valence, whereas others have found a left hemisphere advantage for positive, and a right hemisphere advantage for negative, emotion. Differences in injury aetiology and chronicity, proportion of male participants, participant age, and the number of emotions used within a perception task may contribute to these contradictory findings. The present study therefore controlled and/or directly examined the influence of these possible moderators. Right brain-damaged (RBD; n = 17), left brain-damaged (LSD; n = 17), and healthy control (HC; n = 34) participants completed two face perception tasks (identification and discrimination). No group differences in facial expression perception according to valence were found. Across emotions, the RBD group was less accurate than the HC group, however RBD and LBD group performance did not differ. The lack of difference between RBD and LBD groups indicates that both hemispheres are involved in positive and negative expression perception. The inclusion of older adults and the well-defined chronicity range of the brain-damaged participants may have moderated these findings. Participant sex and general face perception ability did not influence performance. Furthermore, while the RBD group was less accurate than the LED group when the identification task tested two emotions, performance of the two groups was indistinguishable when the number of emotions increased (four or six). This suggests that task demand moderates a study's ability to find hemispheric differences in the perception of facial emotion. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

"Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease. Via autoimmune mediators, AS can damage the auditory system similar to other systems. Otoacoustic emission studies in AS patients showed that the damage that causes hearing loss was in the outer hair cells. The medial olivocochlear (MOC) reflex is used to evaluate the MOC efferent system (MOES), which includes the outer hair cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of subclinical damage in the inner ear with the aid of the MOC reflex test in AS patients with no hearing complaints. Thirty-four patients with AS and a control group of 30 healthy volunteers with similar demographic characteristics were evaluated in the study. Otoacoustic emission responses, MOC reflex results, and frequency-specific and total suppression findings were compared between the groups. The relationship between clinical and laboratory findings for the AS patients, and the MOC reflex data were also investigated. Reduced MOC reflex response (p = 0.04) and suppression (p = 0.019) were detected in AS patients. When the clinical and laboratory findings for the AS patients and the MOC reflex test results were compared, a significant correlation was found only between the MOC reflex and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The results showed that AS can damage the inner ear, especially the MOES, and can reduce the MOC reflex response without clinical hearing loss.

One split into the training and test set was examined. The statistical quality of the developed model was good. The best calculated quantitative structure-activity relationship model had following statistical parameters: r (2) = 0.8097 for the training set and r (2) = 0.9372 for the test set. Structural indicators defined as molecular fragments responsible for increases and decreases in the inhibition activity were calculated. The computer-aided design of new compounds as potential acetylcholine esterase inhibitors with the application of defined structural alerts was presented.

Therefore 30 years of genetics and biochemistry of the spliceosome can now be interpreted at the structural level. I have closely examined the RNase H domain of Prp8 in each of the structures. Interestingly, the RNase H domain has different and unexpected roles in each of the catalytic steps of splicing.

"In the era of cloud computing and big data, virtualization is gaining great popularity in storage systems. Since multiple guest virtual machines (DomUs) are running on a single physical device, disk I/O fairness among DomUs and aggregated throughput remain the challenges in virtualized environments. Although several methods have been developed for disk I/O performance virtualization among multiple DomUs, most of them suffer from one or more of the following drawbacks. (1) A fair scheduling mechanism is missing when requests converge together from multiple queues. (2) Existing methods rely on better performance of the underlying storage system such as solid state drive (SSD). (3) Throughput and latency are not considered simultaneously. To address these disadvantages, this paper presents a virtual multi-channel of disk I/O (VMCD) method that can be built on top of an ordinary storage utility, which mitigates the interference among multiple DomUs by using separated virtual channel (V-Channel) and an I/O request queue for each DomU. In our VMCD, several mechanisms are employed to enhance the I/O performance, including a credit allocation mechanism, a global monitoring strategy, and a virtual multi-channel fair scheduling algorithm. The proposed techniques are implemented on the Xen virtual disk and evaluated on Linux guest operating systems. Experiments results show that VMCD increases fairness by 70 percent approximately compared with CFQ and Anticipatory schedulers, by 30 percent approximately compared with Deadline scheduler; and enhances bandwidth utilization by 28 percent approximately compared with CFQ and Anticipatory schedulers, by 37 percent compared with Deadline in the case of three or more virtual DomUs running on the same physical host.

"A variety of studies on food sharing elucidate both its ultimate and proximate functions in non-human primates, especially in Pan. For chimpanzees, food sharing serves as a means to strengthen social relationships. In contrast, little is known about food sharing in orangutans, since their semi-solitary lifestyle barely provides an opportunity to share food outside of the mother-offspring context. However, recent long-term studies suggest that social bonding might play a more important role for orangutans than previously assumed. In zoos, orangutans are often kept in groups and seem to cope with group living quite well. If captive orangutans use food sharing as a social tool, they are expected to share food frequently and selectively with close social partners and to engage frequently in active transfers. We provided three orangutan groups with monopolizable food and recorded all dyadic food-related interactions. For each dyad, we determined the relationship quality and tested whether it predicts food sharing. We found that, in support of our predictions, almost two thirds of interactions involving food resulted in sharing and that the probability for an individual to share food with a particular partner increased with the strength of their relationship. Exceeding our expectations, food sharing occurred even between individuals from two neighboring groups. Finally, a comparison with studies on captive chimpanzees revealed a significantly higher proportion of active transfers for orangutans suggesting species-specific sharing psychologies. Sharing of food is a universal prosocial behavior in humans. Recent research aims to elucidate its adaptive functions and proximate mechanisms by comparison with other species, especially non-human primates, in natural and captive settings. For bonobos and chimpanzees, our closest relatives, the quality of social relationships was revealed to be important for food sharing. In contrast, there is very limited knowledge on food sharing in orangutans, our most distant and semi-solitary living hominid relatives. This study provides the first systematic investigation of food-sharing patterns and the role of relationship quality in captive orangutans. The results demonstrate that group-living orangutans share frequently and selectively with close associates and even more actively than found for chimpanzees. These findings add further evidence supporting the hypothesis that social bonding played a role in the evolution of human prosocial behavior.

"Current smart devices (phones, tablets, etc.) have integrated light sensors that are used to adjust the screen brightness automatically according with the ambient light variations. The light sensors have become more sensitive and are able to read even the RGB light components. This information however can be accessed without requesting the user special access rights for an application and is also available for the background running services as it can be used in fitness applications. An application can therefore exploit this lack of security and track the user environment luminance information, originating for example from a TV screen, without the user's knowledge. This paper investigates the process of obtaining the sensor data in multiple operating systems, the usability of this data related to the type of light sensor and distance to the light source and outlines a possible data flow for an remote processing application that gathers the information originating from a light sensor and uses it to detect if a reference video source is shown on the user's TV screen.

"The role of fruit and vegetables in human nutrition and public health are taken into account in most nutritional recommendations. Fruit and vegetables contain an abundance of phenolic substances, terpenoids and other natural antioxidants that have been associated with protection from and treatment of chronic diseases such as heart disease or cancer. Terpenoids are a group of substances which occur in nearly every natural food. Their main subclasses discussed as beneficial to maintain and improve health are monoterpenes (like limonene, carvone or carveol), diterpenes (including the retinoids), and tetraterpenes (which include all different carotenoids like alpha- and beta-carotene, lutein, lycopene, zeaxanthine and cryptoxanthine). To be discussed as health promoting or biofunctional, the significant impact of a substance either on human metabolism or on well-defined and appropriate biomarkers must be shown. Based on the latter point, this paper reviews the literature on mono-, di- and tetraterpenes, with special focus on their impact on human health to answer the question of their biofunctionality. Special emphasis will be placed on their different mode of action, e.g. to affect oxidative stress, carcinogenesis and cardiovascular diseases. Copyright (C) 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel.

"Disruption of neuronal morphology contributes to the pathology of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. Here, we show that postnatal deletion of Cdh1, a cofactor of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) ubiquitin ligase in neurons [Cdh1 conditional knockout (cKO)], disrupts dendrite arborization and causes dendritic spine and synapse loss in the cortex and hippocampus, concomitant with memory impairment and neurodegeneration, in adult mice. We found that the dendrite destabilizer Rho protein kinase 2 (Rock2), which accumulates in the brain of AD patients, is an APC/C-Cdh1 substrate in vivo and that Rock2 protein and activity increased in the cortex and hippocampus of Cdh1 cKO mice. In these animals, inhibition of Rock activity, using the clinically approved drug fasudil, prevented dendritic network disorganization, memory loss, and neurodegeneration. Thus, APC/C-Cdh1-mediated degradation of Rock2 maintains the dendritic network, memory formation, and neuronal survival, suggesting that pharmacological inhibition of aberrantly accumulated Rock2 may be a suitable therapeutic strategy against neurodegeneration.

"Due to the requirement of two operational modes, washing and spinning modes of the washing machine, design of the motor to meet the required torque and efficiency in each mode is not an easy task. To achieve the requirements, a 24/16-pole outer rotor type switched reluctance motors (ORSRM) are proposed. To choose the most suitable design parameters for the washing machine, the static toque of the SRM is compared based on the FEM analysis. The selected motor is obtained for high and wide toque than other types of the motor. Further, the pole shape and arc is optimized to get higher torque and lower torque ripple. To verify the proposed structure, the prototype is manufactured. Finally, the simulation and experiment results verify the validity of the proposed structure.

"Social attachment is a biological and affective need. When this need is not met, people experience loneliness. Loneliness is associated with impaired social cognition, and is a risk factor for broad based morbidity across the adult lifespan even after controlling for multiple factors. However, little is known about loneliness in schizophrenia. Eighty-seven non-depressed individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (including 51 inpatients) and 58 control subjects completed the revised UCLA Loneliness scale. Social cognition was assessed with a self-report questionnaire and a performance-based task. Social trait perception was assessed with a facial task. Comorbid medical diagnoses were available for all inpatients. Patients reported greater loneliness levels than controls, while in- and out-patients did not significantly differ. In patients, loneliness was associated with self-report measures of social cognition. Patients' loneliness scores predicted a diagnosis of drug abuse/dependence, number of drugs used, hypertension and abnormal hemoglobin A1c levels. Patients experienced higher levels of loneliness than controls, independently of their objective social isolation. Loneliness did not rely on the same psychological processes in patients than in controls. Loneliness in schizophrenia is a symptom that deserves more scrutiny, particularly as it relates to the high prevalence of metabolic syndrome in this population.

"Slotted liners are flow control devices widely used in both injection and production wells for thermal oil sands recovery operations such as Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage. In these devices, slots are cut into the well at regular intervals around and along the well. The dimensions tend to be from fractions to several millimeters in gap and a few to about twenty centimeters long along the pipe. The key benefits offered by slotted liners are that they are among the most economical solutions for sand control and well bore stability as well as manufacturing. Slotted liners have several design parameters including the slot density, pattern, slot opening size and shape that must be chosen to provide optimum inflow and outflow performance in the reservoir. Due to the complexity in deriving these parameters analytically or experimentally, we have examined the impact of design parameters on steam injection by using a realizable k-epsilon turbulence computational fluid dynamic model of a 5 m slotted liner section coupled to a reservoir flow domain outside of the well governed by a modified Darcy's law that accounts for inertial effects. The results reveal that slot open area affects the flow distribution in the reservoir. The role of drive forces changes through the flow with viscous and pressure forces dominant in the slot and upstream area an(d) inertial forces just downstream of the slot and pressure and viscous forces in the reservoir.

"The purpose of the Charpy test is to determine the impact resistance of materials. It makes it possible to measure their impact strength. It consists of breaking a standard notched bar using a pendulum hammer. The notch can take various forms: out of U or, generally, out of V The power consumption to break the bar is measured by making the difference between the drop height of the hammer and that to which it goes up after having broken the bar. If this last were completely brittle, the hammer would go up with the same height as that from where it fell. If it were on the contrary extremely tough, it would not be broken and the pendulum would not go up at all. The fracture energy thus determined is called impact strength. More it is raised, more the material is tough. Today, this test is identified by measuring of the impact force in accordance with ISO 148-1 and largely used for industrial materials. However, with technological evolution of industrial materials used in manufacturing engineering, other test methods have been developed, in time and complexity, to characterise particularly thin sheet welded pieces (tailored blanks) used in automotive industry. However, one may see a little development in this domain for thin plates regarding to thick plates. This paper reports the early history of instrumented impact testing, started from Augustin Georges Albert CHARPY (1865-1945) up to now, and gives a comparative study on the recent results of experiments obtained on the different welded steel grades by means of the new developed machine called impact tensile crash test or simulated crash test and presents of new ductile/brittle transition diagrams concerning different welding techniques.

"Cardiovascular disease is one of the most rampant causes of death around the world and was deemed as a major illness in Middle and Old ages. Coronary artery disease, in particular, is a widespread cardiovascular malady entailing high mortality rates. Angiography is, more often than not, regarded as the best method for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease; on the other hand, it is associated with high costs and major side effects. Much research has, therefore, been conducted using machine learning and data mining so as to seek alternative modalities. Accordingly, we herein propose a highly accurate hybrid method for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. As a matter of fact, the proposed method is able to increase the performance of neural network by approximately 10% through enhancing its initial weights using genetic algorithm which suggests better weights for neural network. Making use of such methodology, we achieved accuracy, sensitivity and specificity rates of 93.85%, 97% and 92% respectively, on Z-Alizadeh Sani dataset. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"Microneedles (MNs) are micron-scale polymeric or metallic structures that offer distinct advantages for vaccines by efficiently targeting skin-resident immune cells, eliminating injection-associated pain, and improving patient compliance. These advantages, along with recent studies showing therapeutic benefits achieved using traditional intradermal injections in human cancer patients, suggest MN delivery might enhance cancer vaccines and immunotherapies. We recently developed a new class of polyelectrolyte multilayers based on the self assembly of model peptide antigens and molecular toll-like receptor agonists (TLRa) into ultrathin, conformal coatings. Here, we reasoned that these immune polyelectrolyte multilayers (iPEMs) might be a useful platform for assembling cancer vaccine components on MN arrays for intradermal delivery from these substrates. Using conserved human melanoma antigens and a potent TLRa vaccine adjuvant, CpG, we show that iPEMs can be assembled on MNs in an automated fashion. These films, prepared with up to 128 layers, are approximately 200 nm thick but provide cancer vaccine cargo loading >225 mu g/cm(2). In cell culture, iPEM cargo released from MNs is internalized by primary dendritic cells, promotes activation of these cells, and expands T cells during coculture. In mice, application of iPEM-coated MNs results in the codelivery of tumor antigen and CpG through the skin, expanding tumor-specific T cells during initial MN applications and resulting in larger memory recall responses during a subsequent booster MN application. This study support MNs coated with PEMs built from tumor vaccine components as a well-defined, modular system for generating tumor-specific immune responses, enabling new approaches that can be explored in combination with checkpoint blockade or other combination cancer therapies.

"In this article, we present a compact implementation of the Salsa20 stream cipher that is targeted towards lightweight cryptographic devices such as radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags. The Salsa20 stream cipher, ann addition-rotation-XOR (ARX) cipher, is used for high-security cryptography in NEON instruction sets embedded in ARM Cortex A8 CPU core-based tablets and smartphones. The existing literature shows that although classical cryptanalysis has been effective on reduced rounds of Salsa20, the stream cipher is immune to software side-channel attacks such as branch timing and cache timing attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to perform hardware power analysis attacks, where we evaluate the resistance of all eight keywords in the proposed compact implementation of Salsa20. Our technique targets the three subrounds of the first round of the implemented Salsa20. The correlation power analysis (CPA) attack has an attack complexity of 2(19). Based on extensive experiments on a compact implementation of Salsa20, we demonstrate that all these keywords can be recovered within 20,000 queries on Salsa20. The attacks show a varying resilience of the key words against CPA that has not yet been observed in any stream or block cipher in the present literature. This makes the architecture of this stream cipher interesting from the side-channel analysis perspective. Also, we propose a lightweight countermeasure that mitigates the leakage in the power traces as shown in the results of Welch's t-test statistics. The hardware area overhead of the proposed countermeasure is only 14% and is designed with compact implementation in mind.

"A solar thermal and heat pump combisystem is one of many system alternatives on the market for supplying domestic hot water (DHW) and space heating (SH) in dwellings. In this study a reference solar thermal and air source heat pump combisystem was defined and modelled based on products available on the market. Based on the results of an extensive literature survey, several system variations were investigated to show the influence of heat pump cycle, thermal storage and system integration on the use of electricity for two houses in the climates of Zurich and Carcassonne. A singular economic cash flow analysis was carried out and the additional investment limit of each system variation was determined for a range of economic boundary conditions. This is the maximum extra investment cost for the system variant compared to the reference system that will give a break even result for a 10 year period. The results show that variations in electricity price affects the additional investment limit far more than the other economic parameters. Several of the variants show potential for achieving a cost benefit, but the potential varies a lot depending on load and climate boundary conditions. For all variants, the biggest difference in electricity savings was found for Zurich rather than in Carcassonne, which is explained by the larger heating load. However, in three cases the largest savings were for the SFH45 house despite the fact that the annual electricity use of the system is much lower than that for the SFH100 house, 3581 kW h/year compared to 8340 kW h/year. This was attributed to the fact that, in these cases, the operating level of the space heating circuit played a significant role, the SFH45 house being supplied with a 35/30 degrees C heating system while the SFH100 was supplied with a 55/45 degrees C heating system.

We review ACLY as a therapeutic strategy, its genetics, its molecular and cellular biology, and also its inhibition. Recent findings ACLY is a critical enzyme linking glucose catabolism to lipogenesis by providing acetyl-CoA from mitochondrial citrate for fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis. Human genetic variants have been associated with enhanced growth and survival of several cancers, and with attenuated plasma triglyceride responses to dietary fish oil. In mice, liver-specific Acly deficiency protects from hepatic steatosis and dyslipidemia, whereas adipose tissue-specific Acly deletion has no phenotype, supporting therapeutic inhibition of ACLY. A lipid-regulating compound, bempedoic acid, was discovered to potently inhibit ACLY, and in animal models, it prevents dyslipidemia and attenuates atherosclerosis. Phase 2 clinical trials revealed that bempedoic acid effectively lowers LDL-C as monotherapy, combined with ezetimibe, added to statin therapy and in statin-intolerant hypercholesterolemic patients. Summary The efficacy of bempedoic acid as an LDL-C-lowering agent has validated ACLY inhibition as a therapeutic strategy. Positive results of phase 3 patient studies, together with long-term cardiovascular disease outcome trials, are required to establish ACLY as a major new target in cardiovascular medicine.

"Extracted total phenols, flavanols and flavonoids were measured in beer samples and their quality as antioxidants was measured by two modified antioxidant methods: the 2,2'-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) radical cation (ABTS (center dot+)) and the beta-carotene-linoleate model system (beta-carotene). It was found that the antioxidant potential of beer was well correlated with flavanols and flavonoids and was slightly lower with total polyphenols (R 2 values from 0.8203 to 0.9393). Forty-two male non drinkers, hypercholesterolaemic volunteers ages 43-71 after coronary bypass surgery, were randomly divided into experimental (EG) and control (CG) groups, each of 21 participants. The antiatherosclerotic diet of the EG group was supplemented for 30 consecutive days with 330 ml beer per day. Could short-term beer consumption affect not only the risk factors of coronary atherosclerosis, but also the markers of this process: plasma albumin and its antioxidant activity? For this goal, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, plasma albumin and fibrinogen, and the antioxidant activity were determined. After the trial a significant improvement in the plasma lipid levels, and an increase in the plasma antioxidant and anticoagulant activities in patients of the EG group was registered. A parallel increase in the plasma albumin concentration and its antioxidant activity was observed. In conclusion, short-term beer consumption on the basis of the bioactivity of the beverage positively affects plasma lipid levels, plasma antioxidant and anticoagulant activities. The increase in the plasma albumin concentration and its antioxidant activity could be the markers of atherosclerosis status.

"The Mini-RF radar, launched on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, imaged the lunar surface using hybrid-polarimetric, transmitting one circular polarization and receiving linear H and V polarizations. Earth-based radar operating at the same frequency has acquired data of the same terrains using circular-polarized transmit waves and sampling circular polarizations. For lunar targets where the viewing geometry is nearly the same, the polarimetry derived from Mini-RF and the earth-based data should be very similar. However, we have discovered that there is a considerable difference in circular polarization ratio (CPR) values between the two data sets. We investigate possible causes for this discrepancy, including cross-talk between channels, sampling, and the ellipticity of the Mini-RF transmit wave. We find that none of these can reproduce the observed CPR differences, though a nonlinear block adaptive quantization function used to compress the data will significantly distort some other polarimetry products. A comparison between earth-based data sets acquired using two different sampling modes (sampling received linear polarizations and sampling circular polarizations) suggests that the CPR differences may be partially due to sampling the data in a different receive polarimetry bases.

"Logitech made the following statement in 2009: Since the displacements of a mouse would not give any useful information to a hacker, the mouse reports are not encrypted. In this paper, we prove the exact opposite is true-i.e., it is indeed possible to leak sensitive information such as passwords through the displacements of a Bluetooth mouse. Our results can be easily extended to other wireless mice using different radio links. We begin by presenting multiple ways to sniff unencrypted Bluetooth packets containing raw mouse movement data. We then show that such data may reveal text-based passwords entered by clicking on software keyboards. We propose two attacks, the prediction attack and replay attack, which can reconstruct the on-screen cursor trajectories from sniffed mouse movement data. Two inference strategies are used to discover passwords from cursor trajectories. We conducted a holistic study over all popular operating systems and analyzed how mouse acceleration algorithms and packet losses may affect the reconstruction results. Our real-world experiments demonstrate the severity of privacy leakage from unencrypted Bluetooth mice. We also discuss countermeasures to prevent privacy leakage from wireless mice. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to demonstrate privacy leakage from raw mouse data.

"It is widely accepted that amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. In addition, APP has been proposed to have functions in numerous biological processes including neuronal proliferation, differentiation, migration, axon guidance, and neurite outgrowth, as well as in synapse formation and function. However, germline knockout of APP yields relatively subtle phenotypes, and brain development appears grossly normal. This is thought to be due in part to functional compensation by APP family members and other type I transmembrane proteins. Here, we have generated a conditional mouse knockout for APP that is controlled temporally using CreER and tamoxifen administration. We show that total cortical expression of APP is reduced following tamoxifen administration during embryonic time points critical for cortical lamination, and that this results in displacement of Reelin-positive cells below the cortical plate with a concurrent elevation in Reelin protein levels. These results support a role for APP in cortical lamination and demonstrate the utility of a conditional knockout approach in which APP can be deleted with temporal control in vivo. This new tool should be useful for many different applications in the study of APP function across the mammalian life span.

"This paper presents a novel hybrid ant colony optimization approach (ACO&VNS) to solve the permutation flow-shop scheduling problem (PFS) in manufacturing systems and industrial process. The main feature of this hybrid algorithm is to hybridize the solution construction mechanism of the ant colony optimization (ACO) with variable neighborhood search (VNS) which can also be embedded into the ACO algorithm as neighborhood search to improve solutions. Moreover, the hybrid algorithm considers both solution diversification and solution quality. Finally, the experimental results for benchmark PFS instances have shown that the hybrid algorithm is very efficient to solve the permutation flow-shop scheduling in manufacturing engineering compared with the best existing methods in terms of solution quality.

"This paper introduces a Smart Energy Management System capable of controlling energy and smart home devices to optimize the power consumption of several buildings individually and smooth consumption peaks by means of a central system. The proposed model consists of two main systems; the Energy Storage Units and the Central Energy Management System. The first ones are able to store energy, communicate with X10 devices and transmit information regarding household consumption. Finally, the Central System is in charge of controlling the Energy Storage Units, analyzing the information provided through data mining techniques and deciding the best operation strategy for each unit, so that they can smooth their load curves. The strategy consists of a set of semantic rules, based on sequential patterns, which aim to avoid peaks by shutting down low-priority X10 devices and using properly the energy stored.

"Allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) is currently recognized as a clinically effective treatment for allergic diseases, with a unique disease-modifying effect. AIT was introduced in clinical practice one century ago, and performed in the early years with allergenic extracts of poor quality and definition. After the mechanism of allergic reaction were recognized, the practice of AIT was refined, leading to remarkable improvement in the efficacy and safety profile of the treatment. Currently AIT is accepted and routinely prescribed worldwide for respiratory allergies and hymenoptera venom allergy. Both the subcutaneous (SCIT) and sublingual (SLIT) routes of administration are used in the pediatric population. AIT is recommended in allergic rhinitis/conjunctivitis with/without allergic asthma, with an evidence of specific IgE-sensitization towards clinically relevant inhalant allergens. Long-term studies provided evidence that AIT can also prevent the onset of asthma and of new sensitizations. The favorable response to AIT is strictly linked to adherence to treatment, that lasts 3-5 years. Therefore, several factors should be carefully evaluated before starting this intervention, including the severity of symptoms, pharmacotherapy requirements and children and caregivers' preference and compliance. In recent years, there have been increasing interest in the role of AIT for the treatment of IgE-associated food allergy and extrinsic atopic dermatitis. A growing body of evidence shows that oral immunotherapy represents a promising treatment option for IgE-associated food allergy. On the contrary, there are still controversies on the effectiveness of AIT for patients with atopic dermatitis. This consensus document was promoted by the Italian Society of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology (SIAIP) to provide evidence-based recommendations on AIT in order to implement and optimize current prescription practices of this treatment for allergic children.

"Common mode and differential mode impedances are crucial for EMC networks modeling and filter design in particular. In this paper, we propose an original analytical model of common mode and differential mode input impedances of a DC-DC converter, including major parasitical elements. This model has been synthesized using basic laws of electrical circuits. The analysis of the converter circuit is achieved through a switching function modeling its nonlinear behavior. To assess the model performance, PSpice online simulations of common mode and differential mode input impedances are achieved while the devices are operating. The results obtained agree with the analytical model in a wide EMC regulation frequency range (CISPR 22). Furthermore, we have carried out an online experimental test bench by means of a capacitive injection technique. The results obtained confirm the validity of the analytical model. To highlight the impedance switching effect, an offline measurement has also been conducted, using the impedance analyzer (Agilent 4294A).

"Our objectives were to assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL), anxiety, depression of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS) adolescents' parents compared to controls; to assess GTS adolescents' HRQoL compared to controls; to investigate which parental and adolescent variables are associated with poorer parental HRQoL. The controlled study involved GTS outpatients and their parents, adolescent healthy controls matched for gender and age and their parents. Parents' HRQoL was assessed using SF-36 and WHOQOL-BREF; anxiety, depression using HADS. Adolescents' HRQoL was assessed by adolescents using VSP-A instrument and by their parents using VSP-P. A total of 75 GTS adolescents, 75 mothers, 63 fathers were compared to 75 control adolescents, 75 mothers, 62 fathers. GTS mothers had worse HRQoL than controls on 5 of the 8 SF-36 dimensions and 1 of the 4 WHOQOL-BREF dimensions, while GTS fathers had worse HRQoL on 2 of the WHOQOL-BREF dimensions. GTS mothers had poorer HRQoL than fathers. GTS mothers had more depression than control mothers and GTS fathers had more anxiety than control fathers. GTS adolescents had worse HRQoL than controls on 5 of the 9 VSP-A dimensions. Factors significantly related to parental HRQoL were anxiety, depression, GTS adolescents' HRQoL and, concerning mothers, behavioural and emotional adolescents' problems; concerning fathers, severity of vocal tics, duration since first symptoms. This study provides a better understanding of poorer HRQoL and psychiatric morbidity of GTS adolescents' parents. Clinicians should pay attention to their emotional well-being and HRQoL and be aware that mothers and fathers are differently affected.

"The reductionist approach of dissecting biological systems into their constituents has been successful in the first stage of the molecular biology to elucidate the chemical basis of several biological processes. This knowledge helped biologists to understand the complexity of the biological systems evidencing that most biological functions do not arise from individual molecules; thus, realizing that the emergent properties of the biological systems cannot be explained or be predicted by investigating individual molecules without taking into consideration their relations. Thanks to the improvement of the current -omics technologies and the increasing understanding of the molecular relationships, even more studies are evaluating the biological systems through approaches based on graph theory. Genomic and proteomic data are often combined with protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks whose structure is routinely analyzed by algorithms and tools to characterize hubs/bottlenecks and topological, functional, and disease modules. On the other hand, co-expression networks represent a complementary procedure that give the opportunity to evaluate at system level including organisms that lack information on PPIs. Based on these premises, we introduce the reader to the PPI and to the co-expression networks, including aspects of reconstruction and analysis. In particular, the new idea to evaluate large-scale proteomic data by means of co-expression networks will be discussed presenting some examples of application. Their use to infer biological knowledge will be shown, and a special attention will be devoted to the topological and module analysis.

"The term smart grid refers to a modernization of the electrical network consisting in the integration of various technologies such as dispersed generation, dispatchable loads, communication systems and storage devices which operates in grid-connected and islanded modes. As a result, traditional optimization techniques in new power systems have been seriously influenced during the last decade. One of the most important technical and economical tools in this regard is the Optimal Power Flow (OPF). As a fundamental optimization tool in the operation and planning fields, OPF has an undeniable role in the power system. This paper reviews and compares the OPF approaches mainly related to smart distribution grids. In this work, the main OPF approaches are compared in terms of their objective functions, constraints, and methodologies. Furthermore, computational performances, case study networks and the publication date of these methods are reported. Finally, some basic challenges arising from the new OPF methodologies in smart grids are addressed.

"A methodology for predicting scaling in membrane distillation (MD), which considers thermodynamics, kinetics, and fluid mechanics, is developed and experimentally validated with calcium sulfate. The theory predicts the incidence of scaling as a function of temperature, concentration, and flow conditions by comparing the nucleation induction time to the residence time and applying an experimental correction factor. The relevant residence time is identified by considering a volume of solution near the membrane surface that contains enough ions to form a nucleus of critical size. The theory is validated with fouling experiments using calcium sulfate as a model sealant over a range of temperatures (40-70 degrees C) saturation indices, and flow rates. Although the model is validated with a bench-scale MD system, it is hoped to be compatible with large-scale systems that may have significant changes in concentration, temperature, and flow rate along the flow direction. At lower temperatures, the saturation index can be as high as 0.4-0.5 without scaling, but the safe concentration limit decreases with increasing temperature. Increasing the feed flow rate reduces concentration polarization and fluid residence time, both of which decrease the likelihood of fouling. The model is translated into easily readable maps outlining safe operating regimes for MD. The theory and maps can be used to choose safe operating conditions in MD over a wide range of conditions and system geometries.

"Identifying flow processes in multi-aquifer flow systems is a considerable challenge, especially if substantial abstraction occurs. The Rajshahi Barind groundwater flow system in Bangladesh provides an example of the manner in which flow processes can change with time. At some locations there has been a decrease with time in groundwater heads and also in the magnitude of the seasonal fluctuations. This report describes the important stages in a detailed field and modelling study at a specific location in this groundwater flow system. To understand more about the changing conditions, piezometers were constructed in 2015 at different depths but the same location; water levels in these piezometers indicate the formation of an additional water table. Conceptual models are described which show how conditions have changed between the years 2000 and 2015. Following the formation of the additional water table, the aquifer system is conceptualised as two units. A pumping test is described with data collected during both the pumping and recovery phases. Pumping test data for the Lower Unit are analysed using a computational model with estimates of the aquifer parameters; the model also provided estimates of the quantity of water moving from the ground surface, through the Upper Unit, to provide an input to the Lower Unit. The reasons for the substantial changes in the groundwater heads are identified; monitoring of the recently formed additional water table provides a means of testing whether over-abstraction is occurring.

"This paper presents a detailed approach to provide improved cooling and heat spreading in electric machine rotors using centrifugally-pumped revolving thermosiphons. Design concepts are discussed that offer the following advantages: (1) high thermal performance across a wide range of operating points; (2) low-impedance heat paths; (3) excellent opportunities for integration with electric machine design for improved electromagnetic performance and structural design, as well as practical, cost-effective manufacturing. It takes advantage of centrifugal force to provide effective inertial pumping over a wide range of operating conditions. In addition, the new thermosiphon design is compatible, with existing standard electric machine manufacturing techniques and cooling needs. A condenser section fin and ramp structure provides consistently high condensation performance. Surface texture design to promote effective nucleate boiling at high speeds is discussed, and fluid fill factor is analyzed. Applications include induction and PM synchronous machines. Benefits of these thermosiphons include increased steady-state power and torque density, increased and more consistent efficiency, and reduced permanent magnet volume and cost in PM synchronous machines. Other applications may include centrifugal gas compression, chemical processes, and machine tools.

"Objective: In patients with cerebral palsy (CP), psychological problems influence their participation in society. Little is known about the persistence of behavioral and social problems into adulthood. Materials and methods: In a two-center cross-sectional study, caregivers of 121 adults and 88 children were ask to assess behavior of the patients through the parent/caregiver forms of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale II (VABS). Questionnaires were returned from 43 adults and 39 children. Results: In both groups we found the same frequency of abnormalities in attention problems (32.4 vs. 36.1%, p = 0.826) and social interaction problems (32.3 vs. 33.3%; p = 0.926) in the CBCL, and peer problems (38.9 vs. 75.7%; p = 0.115) in the SDQ. Children show a lower percentage of abnormal prosocial behavior (41.7 vs. 16.2%, p = 0.016) and lower abnormal rates of communication (88.2 vs. 61.5; p = 0.01) and daily living skills (90.0 vs. 71.8; p = 0.041), whereas the level of abnormalities in both groups in these dimensions of VABS notably high.

"This research examines the positive role of consumer education in diffusing innovative, sustainable products (ISPs). To enhance the effectiveness of a consumer education campaign, this study explores the type of message framing that can best facilitate product adoption among three different approaches: positive, negative, and hybrid framing. This study also investigates consumer traits and retailer attributes that facilitate or deter product adoption. The empirical application using biofuels shows that a negatively framed educational message highlighting the negative impact of gasoline (versus biofuels) is most effective in leveraging the social desirability of product adoption against its economic disadvantages. Consumertraits positively associated with the adoption of biobutanol are environmental consciousness, prosocial behavior, and openness to new experiences, whereas vertical individualism discourages such adoption. Furthermore, retailer choice attributes of location and payment convenience facilitate adoption, while retailer choice attributes based on price and servicescape cleanliness discourage such adoption.

"The aim was to assess the usefulness of spectral data to detect structural and physiological changes in Citrus crops tinder water and saline stress. Multispectral images were acquired from a fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) while concomitant measurements of gas exchange, plant water status, leaf structural traits and chlorophyll were taken in a commercial farm located in southeast Spain with two Citrus species, grapefruit and mandarin irrigated for eight years with saline reclaimed water (RW) combined with regulated deficit irrigation (RDI). Measurements at leaf scale and airborne flights were carried out twice a day, at 7 and 10 GMT. Irrigation with RW decreased gas exchange and leaf dry mass per unit area (LMA) on grapefruit. However, salinity from RW resulted in an increase in pressure potential (gyp) on mandarin and allowed maintaining net photosynthesis (A) and stomatal conductance (g(s)) when vapour pressure deficit increased. On both crops, leaf total chlorophyll (ChlT) concentrations were significantly reduced by RW. Moreover, RDI decreased A, gs and stem water potential (psi s) on grapefruit, independently of water quality. Regarding spectral data, red wavelength (R) was significantly correlated with Chl T (p < 0.001), except when mandarin was subjected to stressful climatic conditions (at 10 GMT); since R was influenced, in addition to Chl T, by the plant water and gas exchange status. Near infrared (NIR) was a useful indicator of psi s, A and gs on both crops. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was clearly related to gas exchange in both species and to psi s only on mandarin. Finally, we combined data from both Citrus species and the best indicators were NIR and R. The novelty of this study was to show that diurnal changes in physiological and structural traits of Citrus irrigated with RW combined with RDI can be determined by multispectral images from UAVs.

"In this paper we describe a novel proposal in the field of smart cities: using an ontology matching algorithm to guarantee the automatic information exchange between the agents and the smart city. A smart city is composed by different types of agents that behave as producers and/or consumers of the information in the smart city. In our proposal, the data from the context is obtained by sensor and device agents while users interact with the smart city by means of user or system agents. The knowledge of each agent, as well as the smart city's knowledge, is semantically represented using different ontologies. To have an open city, that is fully accessible to any agent and therefore to provide enhanced services to the users, there is the need to ensure a seamless communication between agents and the city, regardless of their inner knowledge representations, i.e., ontologies. To meet this goal we use ontology matching techniques, specifically we have defined a new ontology matching algorithm called OntoPhil to be deployed within a smart city, which has never been done before. OntoPhil was tested on the benchmarks provided by the well known evaluation initiative, Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative, and also compared to other matching algorithms, although these algorithms were not specifically designed for smart cities. Additionally, specific tests involving a smart city's ontology and different types of agents were conducted to validate the usefulness of OntoPhil in the smart city environment.

"Assistive Technologies (AT) are an application area where several Artificial Intelligence techniques and tools have been successfully applied to support elderly or impeded people on their daily activities. However, approaches to AT tend to center in the user-tool interaction, neglecting the user's connection with its social environment (such as caretakers, relatives and health professionals) and the possibility to monitor undesired behaviour providing both adaptation to a dynamic environment and early response to potentially dangerous situations. In previous work we have presented COAALAS, an intelligent social and norm-aware device for elderly people that is able to autonomously organize, reorganize and interact with the different actors involved in elderly-care, either human actors or other devices.

AVICENA's aim is develop a semi-autonomous (collaborative) tool to promote monitored, intensive, extended and personalized therapeutic regime adherence at home based on adaptation techniques.

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a new approach involving guidelines and supporting techniques that guarantees all needed space for appropriate product maintenance. Design/methodology/approach - The approach is based on two major areas: field survey to understand how maintainability parameter is applied and converge theory and practice into a systematic space claim method using computer-aided design (CAD) systems to assure proper maintenance procedures at design stages. Findings - Case studies from a truck industry conducted following the proposed approach contrast the savings that can be achieved by using a proper space claim for aftermarket needs against an unsuitable level of participation by maintenance personnel during the design development. Research limitations/implications - This approach is highly dependent on maintenance experts with suitable skills on CAD systems. Practical implications - Products developed according to the approach envisaged can result in following aspects: lower repair time, better maintenance procedures on key components, easier preventive maintenance, less need for special tools, more ergonomic design, better communication between design and service engineers, simplicity and less complex training. Social implications - Further research on maintainability will provide new information on how to apply this parameter on product development process (PDP), so design teams can better understand and address this relevant issue. The proposed method has been introduced in the PDP of a major multinational automotive company. Originality/value - A new process is presented, considering the protection of needed spaces for maintenance procedures throughout the PDP, diverging to other studies that only propose analysis addressing maintainability at singular point in time during the product development. In just one case study presented, savings of US$1.3m were achieved by applying this space claim approach.

"In this letter, we detail a modular approach for measuring the secondary physical and emotional effects of ambient intelligence (AmI) technology in traffic. Using the case of merges on to a highway, we assess the results of a system that advises the driver to change early to a lane on the left to create space for merging cars downstream (tested using a cellular automata simulation). The indirect impact of the system downstream, namely how the remaining lane changes from the merge lane to the innermost lane proceed, is then evaluated using a time-discrete, space-continuous microscopic traffic simulation tool. This yields detailed results concerning driver interactions that can also be used to derive an estimate of driver anger in the situation. We have used real geographic, traffic and psychological data to test the system, and different models are used to accomplish various tasks. The approach yields (surprisingly) negative results concerning the indirect emotional impact of this AmI intervention which may be due to the nature of the lane changing model used and the chosen parameters. We argue that such an approach is also applicable to similar types of systems, where different data and model types are suited to different scenario elements.

"Malaysia aims to be a developed state by 2020. Various programs and policies towards this have been promulgated and development is rapidly arising as a result. Nevertheless, there is a vital need to balance development and sustainability of water resources in Malaysia. This is important as water demand is steadily increasing in the country's industrialized and highly populated cities. It is significant that water resources be managed efficiently and water conservation efforts such as rainwater harvesting be promoted across the country. This paper aims to examine development policies that may affect the sustainability of water resources and their implementation from the legal point of view. This doctrinal study involves analyses of related laws and development policies and their impact over the development process. The paper concludes that, although important laws and policies have been introduced, implementation has been hindered by lack of support from stakeholders and lack of integration between water agencies.

"Geotextile-reinforced embankments over deep cement mixed (DCM) columns are widely used for the construction of highway embankments over soft clay with low shear strength and high compressibility. Numerical modeling based on the FEM is widely used to investigate the behavior of these embankments during construction and serviceability, incorporating consolidation of the foundation soil over time. However, not much attention has been paid to the strain-softening behavior of DCM columns beyond yield, which is essential in ultimate limit-state computations to determine the stability of embankments during the failure of columns. This paper presents a constitutive model, which is an extension of the Mohr-Coulomb model, for the simulations of strain-softening behavior of cement admixed clays. The model is validated using triaxial test data found in the literature for cement admixed Singapore and Hong Kong marine clays and Ariake clay. A two-dimensional (2D) coupled mechanical and hydraulic numerical implementation of a geotextile-reinforced DCM column-supported (GRCS) embankment constructed over a very soft soil in Finland is carried out incorporating strain-softening behavior of DCM columns. Even though the isolated columns and overlapped column walls used in this embankment do not yield significantly under the service loads, the model simulations show good agreement with field data, confirming the capability of the 2D plane strain finite-element model in predicting the GRCS embankment behavior. Finally, the finite-element model with strain-softening DCM columns is used to investigate the progressive failure of a typical hypothetical GRCS embankment with isolated columns in a square pattern. Results clearly illustrate the bending failure mode caused by progressive softening of the DCM columns, including the plastic hinge development within the columns.

"Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are inherited diseases characterized by lysosomal dysfunction and often showing a neurodegenerative course. There is no cure to treat the central nervous system in LSDs. Moreover, the mechanisms driving neuronal degeneration in these pathological conditions remain largely unknown. By studying mouse models of LSDs, we found that neurodegeneration develops progressively with profound alterations in presynaptic structure and function. In these models, impaired lysosomal activity causes massive perikaryal accumulation of insoluble -synuclein and increased proteasomal degradation of cysteine string protein (CSP). As a result, the availability of both -synuclein and CSP at nerve terminals strongly decreases, thus inhibiting soluble NSF attachment receptor (SNARE) complex assembly and synaptic vesicle recycling. Aberrant presynaptic SNARE phenotype is recapitulated in mice with genetic ablation of one allele of both CSP and -synuclein. The overexpression of CSP in the brain of a mouse model of mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA, a severe form of LSD, efficiently re-established SNARE complex assembly, thereby ameliorating presynaptic function, attenuating neurodegenerative signs, and prolonging survival. Our data show that neurodegenerative processes associated with lysosomal dysfunction may be presynaptically initiated by a concomitant reduction in -synuclein and CSP levels at nerve terminals. They also demonstrate that neurodegeneration in LSDs can be slowed down by re-establishing presynaptic functions, thus identifying synapse maintenance as a novel potentially druggable target for brain treatment in LSDs.

"The most important environmental processes in riparian zones are the release of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus from various organic compounds. The extracellular enzymes of soil microorganisms are involved in the bio-geochemical cycling of organic matter nutrients and may be important for regulating water quality. The objectives of the present study were to determine whether the activities of soil enzymes were affected by different inundation periods in the riparian zone and to identify major factors that influence soil enzyme activity. We subjected three study plots to different inundation conditions (long inundation, moderate inundation, and rare inundation) within the transects perpendicular to the river flow at three sites (Weijiadu, Lijiaocun, and Daxu) in Lijiang, Guilin City, China. Soil physicochemical properties, dissolved nutrient composition, and soil enzyme activities were analyzed. The activity of acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, and arylsulfatase significantly increased as the inundation frequency decreased, whereas the activity of glucosidase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, glycine aminopeptidase, L-leucine aminopeptidase, and dehydrogenase were significantly higher in study plots that received long inundation than in those subjected to moderate or rare inundation. Linear regression indicated that most hydrolase and dehydrogenase activities were affected by soil clay content, soil organic matter, and soil water content, among other factors. NO3--N limited the activity of acid phosphatase, L-leucine aminopeptidase, and glycine aminopeptidase. Polyphenol oxidase activity was constrained by soil water content and available potassium but promoted by NO3--N. Our study demonstrated that imposing longer inundation periods can increase soil enzyme activities. To maintain microbial activity and to minimize water pollution, it is important to reduce high NO3--N loads. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"In visual tracking, learning a robust and efficient appearance model is a challenging task. Model learning determines both the strategy and the frequency of model updating, which contains many details that could affect the tracking results. Self-paced learning (SPL) has recently been attracting considerable interest in the fields of machine learning and computer vision. SPL is inspired by the learning principle underlying the cognitive process of humans, whose learning process is generally from easier samples to more complex aspects of a task. We propose a tracking method that integrates the learning paradigm of SPL into visual tracking, so reliable samples can be automatically selected for model learning. In contrast to many existing model learning strategies in visual tracking, we discover the missing link between sample selection and model learning, which are combined into a single objective function in our approach. Sample weights and model parameters can be learned by minimizing this single objective function. Additionally, to solve the real-valued learning weight of samples, an error-tolerant self-paced function that considers the characteristics of visual tracking is proposed. We demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our tracker on a recent tracking benchmark data set with 50 video sequences. (C) 2017 SPIE and IS&T

"Priority wise channelization of resources is the key to successful environmental management, especially when funds are limited. The study in hand has successfully developed an algorithmic criterion to compare hazardous effects of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) dumping sites quantitatively. It is a Multi Criteria Analysis (MCA) that has made use of the scaling function to normalize the data values, Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) for assigning weights to input parameters showing their relevant importance, and Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) for aggregating the normalized scores. Input parameters have been divided into three classes namely Resident's Concerns, Groundwater Vulnerability and Surface Facilities. Remote Sensing data and GIS analysis were used to prepare most of the input data. To elaborate the idea, four dumpsites have been chosen as case study, namely Old-FSD, New-FSD, Saggian and Mahmood Booti. The comparison has been made first at class levels and then class scores have been aggregated into environmental normalized index for environmental impact ranking. The hierarchy of goodness found for the selected sites is New-FSD >Old-FSD >Mahmood Booti >Saggian with comparative scores of goodness to environment as 36.67, 28.43, 21.26 and 13.63 respectively. Flexibility of proposed model to adjust any number of classes and parameters in one class will be very helpful for developing world where availability of data is the biggest hurdle in research based environmental sustainability planning. The model can be run even without purchasing satellite data and GIS software, with little inaccuracy, using imagery and measurement tools provided by Google Earth.

"Although authentic dialogue between teachers and young children is vital to the learning process, increasingly diverse student populations and a focus on high-stakes testing, challenge teachers' approaches to such conversations. This study examined the verbal and nonverbal interactions between five teachers and young children using child-taken photographs to promote conversation. Analysis exposed how the teachers' nonverbal and verbal responsiveness opened and closed conversational spaces for the children to describe their home contexts. This teacher-child dance illuminates the necessary and effective pursuit of attending to both verbal and nonverbal communication in authentic dialogue and suggests a teacher choreograph that, when attended to, is positioned for effective and efficient use within the increasingly diverse and time-pressured classroom.

"Sweetpotatoes are important food crops with high starch and high carotene content. However, studies concerning the molecular biology of these crops are limited. In this paper, we selected two varieties of sweetpotato (Zhengshu 20 and Luoxushu 8) for transcriptome analysis. De novo RNA sequencing of these sweetpotatoes (tuberous roots, stems and leaves) under field conditions was performed using an Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform with PE125. Approximately 34.4 G nucleotide bases were sequenced. Following assembly, 176,167 transcripts and 109,401 unigenes were identified. 41,729 (Nr), 21,004 (Nt), 12,524 (KO), 29,444 (SwissProt), 30,212 (PFAM), 31,304 (GO), and 14,349 (KOG) unigenes were functionally annotated using different databases, and a total of 47,749 annotated sequences were identified. Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) analyses revealed 9549 SSR loci on the 8334 unigenes. The KEGG analysis uncovered 55 and 78 unigenes involved in the carotenoid and terpe-noid backbone biosynthesis pathways, respectively. Among these genes, 20 and 10 differentially expressed unigenes were observed in the Zhengshu 20 and Luoxushu 8, respectively. Eight differentially expressed unigenes were validated by qRT-PCR. Thus, we prepared and analyzed the transcriptome data of the two sweetpotato varieties, for which prior genomic information was limited. This new sequence information will improve the current knowledge in this important and healthy crop and provide valuable insight for further biological research. (C) 2017 SAAB.

"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by progressive loss of cognition. Over 35 million individuals currently have AD worldwide. Unfortunately, current therapies are limited to very modest symptomatic relief. The brains of AD patients are characterized by the deposition of amyloid-beta and hyperphosphorylated forms of tau protein. AD brains also show neurodegeneration and high levels of oxidative stress and inflammation. The phytocannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD) possesses neuroprotective, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and reduces amyloid-beta production and tau hyperphosphorylation in vitro. CBD has also been shown to be effective in vivo making the phytocannabinoid an interesting candidate for novel therapeutic interventions in AD, especially as it lacks psychoactive or cognition-impairing properties. CBD treatment would be in line with preventative, multimodal drug strategies targeting a combination of pathological symptoms, which might be ideal for AD therapy. Thus, this review will present a brief introduction to AD biology and current treatment options before outlining comprehensively CBD biology and pharmacology, followed by in-vitro and in-vivo evidence for the therapeutic potential of CBD. We will also discuss the role of the endocannabinioid system in AD before commenting on the potential future of CBD for AD therapy (including safety aspects). (C) 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Background: Addicts to specific internet applications involving communication features showed increased social anxiety, emotional competence deficits and impaired prefrontal-related inhibitory control. The dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex (dACC) likely plays an important role in cognitive control and negative affect (such as social exclusion, pain or anxiety). Aim: To assess (social) anxiety-related inhibitory control in specific Internet addiction (addicted use of games and social networks) and its relation to altered dACC activation. Methods: N=44 controls and n=51 specific internet addicts completed an anxious words-based Affective Go/No-Go task (AGN). A subsample of n=23 healthy controls and n=25 specific internet addicts underwent functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) while completing an Emotional Stroop Task (EST) with socially anxious, positive, negative and neutral words. Subgroups of internet gaming and social network addicts were exploratively assessed. Psychometric measures of social anxiety, emotional competence and impulsivity were additionally explored. Results: Specific internet addicts showed higher impulsivity, social anxiety and reduced emotional competence. Between-group differences in AGN and EST behavioral measures were not detected. No group differences were found in the dACC, but explorative analyses revealed decreased left middle and superior temporal gyrus activation during interference of socially anxious words in internet gaming and relative to social network addicts.

"For more flexibility of environmental perception by artificial intelligence it is needed to exist the supporting software modules, which will be able to automate the creation of specific language syntax and to make a further analysis for relevant decisions based on semantic functions. According of our proposed approach, of which implementation it is possible to create the couples of formal rules of given sentences (in case of natural languages) or statements (in case of special languages) by helping of computer vision, speech recognition or editable text conversion system for further automatic improvement. In other words, we have developed an approach, by which it can be achieved to significantly improve the training process automation of artificial intelligence, which as a result will give us a higher level of self-developing skills independently from us (from users). At the base of our approach we have developed a software demo version, which includes the algorithm and software code for the entire above mentioned component's implementation (computer vision, speech recognition and editable text conversion system). The program has the ability to work in a multi - stream mode and simultaneously create a syntax based on receiving information from several sources.

"The dynamics of a population undergoing selection is a central topic in evolutionary biology. This question is particularly intriguing in the case where selective forces act in opposing directions at two population scales. For example, a fast-replicating virus strain outcompetes slower-replicating strains at the within-host scale. However, if the fast-replicating strain causes host morbidity and is less frequently transmitted, it can be outcompeted by slower-replicating strains at the between-host scale. Here we consider a stochastic ball-and-urn process which models this type of phenomenon. We prove the weak convergence of this process under two natural scalings. The first scaling leads to a deterministic nonlinear integro-partial differential equation on the interval [0,1] with dependence on a single parameter, lambda. We show that the fixed points of this differential equation are Beta distributions and that their stability depends on lambda and the behavior of the initial data around 1. The second scaling leads to a measure-valued Fleming-Viot process, an infinite dimensional stochastic process that is frequently associated with a population genetics.

"Studies are described on the metabolism and the toxico-logic analysis of the nonopioid Cough suppressant dropropizine [R,S-3-(4-phenyl-1-piperazinyl) 1,2-propandiol, DRO] in human urine using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The metabolisin studies showed that DRO was metabolized in humans mainly by hydroxylation of the aromatic ring, by N-dealkytation of the parent drug and of the hydroxyl-metabolite to the corresponding N-phenylpiperazines, and by degradation of the piperazine moiety. The authors' systematic toxicologic analysis (STA) procedure using full-scan GC-MS after acid hydrolysis, liquid-liquid extraction, and microwave-assisted acetylation allowed the unambiguous detection of DRO and its above-mentioned metabolites in human urine up to about 32 hours after intake of a single common therapeutic dose. The target analytes were found to be the parent compound DRO (earlier phase of excretion) and the hydroxylated metabolite para-hydroxy-DRO (later phase of excretion). Both allowed unambiguous detection of an intake of DRO and also differentiation from other phenylpiperazine derivatives.

"Dual boundary integral equation (BIE) was developed for problems containing degenerate boundaries in 1988 by Hong and Chen [Journal of Engineering Mechanics-ASCE, 114, 6, 1988] and was termed the dual boundary element method (BEM) in 1992 by Portela et al. [International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering, 33, 6, 1992]. After near 30 years, the dual BIE/BEM for the problem containing a zero-thickness barrier was revisited mathematically to study the rank deficiency from the viewpoint of the updating term and the updating document of singular value decomposition (SVD) [Journal of Mechanics, 31, 5, 2015]. In this paper, we revisit the dual BEM from the physical point of view. Although there is no zero-thickness barrier in the real world, it is always required to simulate a finite-thickness degenerate boundary to be zero-thickness in comparison with sea, air or earth scale. For example, a sheet pile, a screen, a crack problem, a thin airfoil and a breakwater were modeled by the geometry of zero-thickness. The role of the dual BEM is evident since Lafe et al. [Journal of the Hydraulics Division-ASCE, 106, 6, 1980] used the conventional BEM to model the finite-thickness pile wall to geometrically approximate zero-thickness barrier but numerically yielding divergent solution. On the contrary, we physically model the finite-thickness breakwater as a zero-thickness barrier. The breakwater is employed as an illustrative case to demonstrate that the dual BEM simulated by a zero-thickness barrier can yield more acceptable results to match the experiment data in comparison with those of the finite thickness using the conventional BEM. Finally, a single horizontal plate and two dual horizontal plates in vertical direction and in horizontal direction are three illustrative cases to tell you why the dual BEM is necessary not only in mathematics but also in physics.

"Design for manufacturing (DFM), especially the use of manufacturing knowledge to support design decisions, has received attention in the academic domain. However, industry practice has not been studied enough to provide solutions that are mature for industry. The current state of the art for DFM is often rule-based functionality within computer-aided design (CAD) systems that enforce specific design requirements. That rule-based functionality may or may not dynamically affect geometry definition. And, if rule-based functionality exists in the CAD system, it is typically a customisation on a case-by-case basis. Manufacturing knowledge is a phrase with vast meanings, which may include knowledge on the effects of material properties decisions, machine and process capabilities or understanding the unintended consequences of design decisions on manufacturing. One of the DFM questions to answer is: How can manufacturing knowledge, depending on its definition, be used earlier in the product life cycle to enable a more collaborative development environment? This paper will discuss the results of a workshop on manufacturing knowledge that highlights several research questions needing more study. This paper proposes recommendations for investigating the relationship of manufacturing knowledge with shape, behaviour and context characteristics of a product to produce a better understanding of what knowledge is most important. In addition, the proposal includes recommendations for investigating the system-level barriers to reusing manufacturing knowledge and how model-based manufacturing may ease the burden of knowledge sharing. Lastly, the proposal addresses the direction of future research for holistic solutions of using manufacturing knowledge earlier in the product life cycle.

"A series of neurological and psychiatric symptoms occur after traumatic brain injury (TBI), with cognitive dysfunction being one of the most prominent sequela. Given that tau hyperphosphorylation is an important cause of cognitive impairment in patients of Alzheimer's disease, our present study detected the presence of hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau), mainly at Ser404, in multiple brain regions, including the ipsilateral parietal cortex, contralateral hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, immediately after the injury in a mouse TBI model; these changes lasted for at least 4w. All of these brain regions play important roles in working memory. Hyperphosphorylated tau protein was primarily located in neurons and was accompanied by axonal injury and dendritic spine degeneration. Our study demonstrated that p-tau spreads gradually and selectively from the injured cortex to other brain regions after TBI and that all of the affected regions are part of the working memory circuit. These findings provide experimental support for the role of p-tau in cognitive impairment in the early phase after TBI. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"Remote sensing observations are extensively used for analysis of environmental variables. These variables often exhibit spatial correlation, which has to be accounted for in the calibration models used in predictions, either by direct modelling of the dependencies or by allowing for spatially correlated stochastic effects. Another feature in many remote sensing instruments is that the derived predictor variables are highly correlated, which can lead to unnecessary model over-training and at worst, singularities in the estimates. Both of these affect the prediction accuracy, especially when the training set for model calibration is small. To overcome these modelling challenges, we present a general model calibration procedure for remotely sensed data and apply it to airborne laser scanning data for forest inventory. We use a linear regression model that accounts for multicollinearity in the predictors by principal components and Bayesian regularization. It has a spatial random effect component for the spatial correlations that are not explained by a simple linear model. An efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling scheme is used to account for the uncertainty in all the model parameters. We tested the proposed model against several alternatives and it outperformed the other linear calibration models, especially when there were spatial effects, multicollinearity and the training set size was small.

"Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) introduced in 2005 by Hughes et al. (2005) [1] exploits one mathematical basis representation for computer aided design (CAD), geometry and analysis during the entire engineering process. In this paper we extend this concept also for visualization. The presented post-processing and visualization techniques thereby strengthen the relation between geometry, analysis and visualization. This is achieved by facilitating the same mathematical function space used for geometry and analysis also for post-processing and visualization purposes. During non-linear analysis derivatives are incrementally computed and stored with different basis function representations. We introduce and investigate projection methods to be able to use the same function space for both displacements and stresses without loss of accuracy. To obtain a common representation for structured and unstructured meshes like hierarchical spline, locally refined B-spline (LR B-spline) and T-spline techniques we exploit Bezier decomposition in a post-processing step resulting in a Bezier element representation and constitute it as generalized representation. The typically used unrelated (fictitious) finite element mesh representation for visualization purposes are easily replaced without changing the underlying geometry as well as the algorithmic data structure. One further benefit of the used Bezier decomposition lies in the fact that it facilitates a natural parallel implementation on Graphics Processor Units (GPUs) exploiting shader programming. In this paper we have developed and investigated an accurate, efficient and practical post-processing pipeline for visualization of isogeometric analysis results. The proposed IGA visualization pipeline consists of three steps: (1) Projection, (2) Bezier decomposition and (3) Pixel-accurate rendering. We have tested four different projection methods. A description on how to perform Bezier decomposition of LR B-splines are given (whereas for hierarchical and T-splines this has been done before). Furthermore, the use of GPU shader programming to enable efficient and pixel-accurate visualization is detailed. The performance of the four different projection techniques has been tested on manufactured problems as well as on realistic benchmark problems. Furthermore, the IGA visualization pipeline has been demonstrated on a number of real-world applications. (C) 2016 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

"Adipokines, pleiotropic molecules produced by white adipose tissue (WAT) have attracted the attention of scientists since 1994. The role of adipokines in metabolic syndrome is known and fixed. Adipokines exerting a variety of metabolic activities have contributed to the ethiopathogenesis and the consequences of metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, adipokines are involved in the regulation of inflammatory processes and autoimmunity in the light of pathogenesis of connective tissue diseases. Given some evidence for the influence of adipokines in metabolic syndrome, there may be a link between CVDs and rheumatic diseases. This review provides an overview of the literature focusing on the role of adipokines in rheumatic diseases by putting special emphasis on the potential role of leptin, resistin, adiponectin, chemerin, visfatin and novel adipokines in connective tissue diseases.

"Purpose: The primary objective was to use isotemporal substitution models to estimate whether replacing time spent in sedentary video games (SVGs) and active outdoor play (AOP) with active video games (AVGs) would be associated with changes in youth's mental health. Methods: A representative sample of 20,122 Canadian youth in Grades 6-10 was studied. The exposure variables were average hours/day spent playing AVGs, SVGs, and AOP. The outcomes consisted of a negative and internalizing mental health indicator (emotional problems), a positive and internalizing mental health indicator (life satisfaction), and a positive and externalizing mental health indicator (prosocial behavior). Isotemporal substitution models estimated the extent to which replacing time spent in SVGs and AOP with an equivalent amount of time in AVGs had on the mental health indicators. Results: Replacing 1 hour/day of SVGs with 1 hour/day of AVGs was associated with a 6% (95% confidence interval: 3%-9%) reduced probability of high emotional problems, a 4% (2%-7%) increased probability of high life satisfaction, and a 13% (9%-16%) increased probability of high prosocial behavior. Replacing 1 hour/day of AOP with 1 hour/day of AVGs was associated with a 7% (3%-11%) increased probability of high emotional problems, a 3% (1%-5%) reduced probability of high life satisfaction, and a 6% (2%-9%) reduced probability of high prosocial behavior. Conclusions: Replacing SVGs with AVGs was associated with more preferable mental health indicators. Conversely, replacing AOP with AVGs was associated with more deleterious mental health indicators.

"Multiple kernel learning (MKL) algorithms are proposed to address the problems associated with kernel selection of the kernel-based classification algorithms. Using a group of kernels rather than one single kernel, the MKL algorithms aim to provide better classification efficiency. This paper presents new similarity-based MKL algorithms to classify remote-sensing images. These algorithms find the optimal combination of kernels by maximizing the similarity between a combination of kernels and an ideal kernel. In this framework, we initially introduced three similarity measures to be used: kernel alignment, norm of kernel difference, and Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion. Then, we proposed to solve the optimization problems of the MKL algorithm associated with each similarity measure adopting heuristic and convex optimization methods. The performances of the proposed algorithms were compared with a single kernel support vector machines as well as other MKL algorithms for classifying the features extracted from the high-resolution and hyperspectral images. The results demonstrated that the similarity-based MKL algorithms performed better than other algorithms, especially when their optimization problems were solved using the convex optimization methods or when few training samples were available. Moreover, when the optimization problems of these algorithms were solved using the heuristic optimization methods, they were able to yield acceptable performances and were faster than other MKL algorithms.

"Glutamate is an essential excitatory neurotransmitter that regulates brain functions, and its activity is tightly regulated by glutamate transporters. Excess glutamate in the synaptic cleft and dysfunction of excitatory amino acid transporters have been shown to be involved in development of Alzheimer's disease, but the precise regulatory mechanism is poorly understood. Using a D-[H-3]-aspartic acid uptake assay, we found that A beta(1-42) oligomers impaired glutamate uptake in astrocytes and neurons. In astrocytes, this process was accompanied by reduced expression of GLT-1 and GLAST as detected by Western blot and immunocytofluorescence. However, mRNA levels of EAATs detected by qPCR in astrocytes and neurons were not altered, which suggests that this process is post-translational. Co-localization analysis using immunocytofluorescence showed that ubiquitylation of GLT-1 significantly increased. Therefore, we hypothesized that A beta(1-42) oligomers-induced endocytosis of astrocytic GLT-1 may be involved in ubiquitylation. In addition, A beta(1-42) oligomers enhanced secretion of IL-beta,TNF-alpha, and IL-6 into culture supernatant, which may be correlated with an inflammatory response and altered EAATs expression or function in Alzheimer's disease. These findings support the idea that dysregulation of the glutamatergic system may play a significant role in pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, enhancing expression or function of EAATs in astrocytes and neurons might be a new therapeutic approach in treatment of Alzheimer's disease. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"Recycling is defined as the process that changes materials into new products for preventing the waste of potentially useful materials, reducing the consumption of fresh raw materials, the energy usage and the air and water pollution. Many of the large, existing buildings which don't have any historical importance, such as industrial type, office buildings or apartments, have a reinforced concrete structure. Recycled concrete is mainly used as coarse aggregate and filler in road construction industry; another usage of it could be adding it into new mixtures. So far this usage has led to a significant decrease in mechanical properties for the new mixture. It is well known that the cement industry is an important energy consumer and also a CO2 releaser. Present paper is devoted to the use of recycled concrete materials obtained from concrete elements into new mixes as a replacement of the cement. An experimental program was developed in this purpose; physical and physical-chemical tests were made on obtained materials, The mechanical properties of the obtained mortar samples have been also studied.

"In this paper, we focus on tackling the problem of automatic accurate localization of detected objects in high-resolution remote sensing images. The two major problems for object localization in remote sensing images caused by the complex context information such images contain are achieving generalizability of the features used to describe objects and achieving accurate object locations. To address these challenges, we propose a new object localization framework, which can be divided into three processes: region proposal, classification, and accurate object localization process. First, a region proposal method is used to generate candidate regions with the aim of detecting all objects of interest within these images. Then, generic image features from a local image corresponding to each region proposal are extracted by a combination model of 2-D reduction convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Finally, to improve the location accuracy, we propose an unsupervised score-based bounding box regression (USB-BBR) algorithm, combined with a nonmaximum suppression algorithm to optimize the bounding boxes of regions that detected as objects. Experiments show that the dimension-reduction model performs better than the retrained and fine-tuned models and the detection precision of the combined CNN model is much higher than that of any single model. Also our proposed USB-BBR algorithm can more accurately locate objects within an image. Compared with traditional features extraction methods, such as elliptic Fourier transform-based histogram of oriented gradients and local binary pattern histogram Fourier, our proposed localization framework shows robustness when dealing with different complex backgrounds.

"Shallow coastal areas of oceans, seas and lakes pose significant remote sensing and navigational challenges due to the transient nature of bathymetric features that characterize these areas (e.g., shoals and shoaling). Seabed data/ maps often represent these areas as white ribbon zones, where sparse data coverage presents a particular challenge to defining and enforcing sustainable use of marine resources. Given the lengthy perimeter of coastlines, there is a need for cost-efficient methods for producing high resolution maps of shallow areas. The research described here compares airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) with shipboard acoustic surveys around the Kvarken Archipelago of the northern Baltic Sea. The Kvarken Archipelago includes a unique, brackish shallow water marine environment with a number of moraines. The landscape of the area is characterised by fields of ridged, washboard-like De Geer moraines. The moraines combined with an ongoing glacio-isostatic uplift typical of the area, lead into succession of the elevated structures from the seafloor to land, where present seabed structures will rise on land in future. The ongoing modification of the environment by both climatic and geologic forces contributes to complex geomorphic and ecological feedback systems operating on a range of spatial and temporal scales. Airborne LiDAR can provide high resolution remote sensing data on shallow coastal areas. The technology is especially effective in areas with very shoal waters, like those found along the Finnish coast. LiDAR enables continuous detection of topographic (elevation) and bathymetric (depth) data and can thus generate continuous maps of transition zones between continental and marine areas. Environmental conditions such as water clarity and ice cover can affect LiDAR depth detection capabilities: these conditions require complementary accuracy assessment strategies. As LiDAR cannot determine detailed information on seafloor surface substrate, and anything on subsurface substrate type, geological conditions are determined through the application of acoustic-seismic. methods, sediment sampling and underwater video. Data from LiDAR surveys provide a detailed topographic and bathymetric map of the study area up to water depths of 14 m. The seabed bathymetry model shows a series of elevated, narrow, elongate features that appear throughout the study area. These parallel ridges represent the uppermost geomorphic features of the seafloor. Interpretation of acoustic bathymetric surveys indicates that these ridges are De Geer moraines. The general orientation of these moraines differs from that associated with older features of the northern Kvarken Archipelago. Eroded remnants of older De Geer moraines are overprinted at a high angle by the younger landforms. De Geer moraines in the study area thus represent two phases of deglaciation and finally the eastward ice-sheet/ice edge retreat. The combined approach of using LiDAR and acoustic bathymetric data provides new insights into past glacial dynamics of the Kvarken Archipelago and the Gulf of Bothnia.

"Objectives. To evaluate the impact and risk factors associated with an abnormal exercise test ( ET) in systemic inflammatory rheumatic disease ( SIRD) patients before commencing supervised physical exercise. Methods. A total of 235 SIRD patients were enrolled in three controlled clinical trials, including 103 RA, 42 SLE and 57 AS patients. The control group consisted of 231 healthy, sedentary subjects matched for age, gender and BMI. All performed an ET, according to Bruce's or Ellestad's protocol. Cardiovascular disease risk factors, medications, comorbidities and details of each SIRD were assessed. Results. SIRD patients had a higher percentage of abnormal ETs compared with the control group, especially exercise hypertensive behaviour, higher oxygen consumption, higher resting heart rate and heart rate at the first minute of recovery, and chronotropic incompetence (C-Inc) (P < 0.001). The disease itself was involved with higher likelihood of having an abnormal ET [Odds ratio (OR) = 12.0, 95% CI: 2.5, 56.7; P = 0.002 for SLE; OR = 13.56, 95% CI: 6.16, 29.8; P < 0.001 for RA; and OR = 4.31, 95% CI: 1.17, 15.8; P = 0.028, for AS]. Each 10-year increment of age increased the chance of having an abnormal ET by 13% (P = 0.008) in AS patients, as well as hypertension (OR = 7.14, 95% CI: 1.61, 31.6; P = 0.01). Regarding C-Inc, age played a protective role (OR = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.78, 0.99; P = 0.043) in SLE, and ASDAS-ESR was associated with a higher risk in AS (OR = 2.73, 95% CI: 0.93, 8.0; P = 0.067). Conclusion. Our results showed a higher prevalence of abnormal ETs in asymptomatic cardiovascular SIRD patients, and the disease itself was associated with a higher likelihood of having an abnormal test, emphasizing the relevance and need of performing it before starting supervised physical exercise.

We present the design considerations and a real implementation and validation of the system in one of the most challenging environments that may exist in a city: a tunnel. The main advantages of the Smart Signal are the improvement of the actual functionality of the signal providing new interaction capabilities with users and a new sensory mechanism of the Smart City.

"Background: Most countries have started to educate students with special educational needs (SEN) in mainstream schools, but it remains unclear how inclusive attitudes towards students with SEN can be promoted. Aims: This study investigated the role of adolescents' friendships and socio-moral competencies for their attitudes towards the inclusion of students with SEN. Specifically, we studied whether adolescents without SEN would develop more inclusive attitudes if they had close friendships with SEN students and if they expressed negative emotions about social exclusion. Methods: Adolescents' inclusive attitudes and their emotions were gathered from survey data of 1225 Swiss students aged 11-13. Social network data were collected to assess adolescents' friendship relationships. Results: The results indicated that adolescents' friendship closeness with SEN students positively related to their inclusive attitudes. However, this was only true for adolescents who anticipated more negative than positive emotions if a student with SEN was excluded. Implications: These findings highlight the role of friendship relationships between adolescents with and without SEN and adolescents' socio-moral experiences for their attitudes towards the inclusion of peers with SEN.

"In the manufacturing field it happens that products are processed by high-speed production lines. They pass through different machines in order to be processed, according to a pre-established order, resting on moving supports. Usually they do not stop during this process: rather, the machines are able to track and handle them while they are moving. The advantages of this kind of process stem from the continuous motion of the product, that results in an increased productivity since there is no downtime during the production. As a consequence, the tracking of goods is widely adopted to process, to manipulate and to package the products. As reported in literature, strong effort is being directed at the development of an effective control system allowing for the synchronization of the operations and the detection of the position of the incoming products. All of these systems are generally called cutting systems on the fly. For the design and the setup of these systems, it is critical to have a tool to simulate and analyse the behaviour of the machine. This article proposed a systemic approach to model the main elements that characterize such systems aimed to develop the most effective control strategy to improve the performance of the machine. The simulation tool allows to predict the behaviour of the machine and to test different control strategies.

"Testicular spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) are a heterogeneous population of stem cells, and definitive marker for the most primitive subset that undergoes asymmetric cell division remains to be identified. A novel subpopulation of pluripotent, very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs) has been reported in both human and mouse testes. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) receptors (FSHRs) are expressed on Sertoli cells in testis and on granulosa cells in ovary, but recently FSHRs are reported on VSELs in ovaries, bone marrow, and cord blood. The present study was aimed to investigate whether FSHRs are also expressed on testicular stem cells (VSELs and SSCs) and their possible modulation by FSH using intact and chemoablated (25 mg/kg busulfan) mice. Chemoablated testis was a better model to study stem cell biology since quiescent stem cells survive along with the Sertoli cells in the tubules. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive, small-sized cells presumed to be VSELs were clearly visualized, and flow cytometry analysis revealed an increase in LIN-/CD45(-)/SCA-1(+) VSELs from 0.045 +/- 0.008% to 0.1 +/- 0.03% of total cells in chemoablated testis after FSH treatment. Very small embryonic-like stem cells expressing nuclear octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT-4) and SSCs with cytoplasmic OCT-4 were detected. Very small embryonic-like stem cells (Oct-4A, Sca-1, Nanog), SSCs (Oct-4), and proliferation (Pcna) specific transcripts were upregulated on FSH treatment. Stem cells expressed FSHR and were stimulated by FSH, and Fshr3 was the predominant transcript maximally modulated by FSH. Nuclear OCT-4 and SCA-1 (stem cell antigen 1) positive VSELs are the most primitive stem cells in testis, and FSH stimulates them to undergo asymmetric cell division including self-renewal and give rise to SSCs, which in turn proliferate rapidly and undergo clonal expansion and further differentiation.

"Synadenium grantii is frequently used for the treatment of various diseases such as allergies, gastric disorders, and especially cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible antiproliferative potential of the methanol extract, fractions, and pure compounds from the stems of S grantii. Phytochemical analysis was carried out by conventional chromatographic techniques, and the antiproliferative activity was analyzed using the sulforhodamine B assay and an MTT-based assay. Nonpolar fraction and its subfractions from the stems of S grantii exhibited promising cytostatic effect against several human tumor cell lines (glioma, breast, kidney, and lung), with total grown inhibition values ranging from 0.37 to 2.9 g/mL. One of the active principles of this plant was identified as a rare phorbol diterpene ester, denoted as 3,4,12,13-tetraacetylphorbol-20-phenylacetate. This compound demonstrated antiproliferative activity against glioma, kidney, lung, and triple-negative breast cancer cell lines. These results demonstrate that S grantii stems produce active principles with relevant antiproliferative potential.

"The aim was to evaluate the relationship between maternal corticosteroid use during first trimester of pregnancy and risk of orofacial clefts (OC). The overall findings showed a certain association between maternal corticosteroid use and occurrence of OC, compared with non-users (OR= 1.16 [95% CI: 1.01-1.33]). When study type was considered this association was significant only for case-control studies (OR = 1.22 [95% CI: 1.02-1.47]), and not for cohort studies (OR = 1.09 [95% CI: 0.88-1.34]) when there are many confounders (dose, route of application, disease etc.) and biases (re-call, loss-to followup etc.) that still need to be considered. A subgroup analysis based on the type of OC gave an overall OR of 1.41 (95% CI: 1.14-1.74) in the case-control studies for cleft lip with or without palate (CL/P) and 1.09 (95% CI: 0.80-1.48) for cleft palate only (CPO), when comparing maternal corticosteroid users with non-users. However, for cohort studies, the overall OR for CL/P is 1.06 (95% CI: 0.82-1.37) and 1.20 (95% CI: 0.83-1.75) for CPO. The absolute risk of facial cleft after prenatal exposure to corticosteroids, if any, is small. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

"A theoretical model is proposed that specifies lay causal theories of behavior; and supporting experimental evidence is presented. The model's basic assumption is that different types of behavior trigger different hypotheses concerning the types of causes that may have brought about the behavior. Seven categories are distinguished that are assumed to serve as both behavior types and explanation types: goals, dispositions, temporary states such as emotions, intentional actions, outcomes, events, and stimulus attributes. The model specifies inference rules that lay people use when explaining behavior (actions are caused by goals; goals are caused by higher order goals or temporary states; temporary states are caused by dispositions, stimulus attributes, or events; outcomes are caused by actions, temporary states, dispositions, stimulus attributes, or events; events are caused by dispositions or preceding events). Two experiments are reported. Experiment 1 showed that free-response explanations followed the assumed inference rules. Experiment 2 demonstrated that explanations which match the inference rules are generated faster and more frequently than non matching explanations. Together, the findings support models that incorporate knowledge based aspects into the process of causal explanation. The results are discussed with respect to their implications for different stages of this process, such as the activation of causal hypotheses and their subsequent selection, as well as with respect to social influences on this process.

"Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a heart failure syndrome occurring late in pregnancy or during the early post-natal period. The pathophysiology of peripartum cardiomyopathy is not fully understood and various mechanisms have been postulated including an underlying inflammatory process. We here report four cases presenting with acute left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Three out of four of the patients presented with a left ventricular ejection fraction <30% and one with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%. All made a full clinical recovery following treatment with high-dose intravenous steroids. This case series adds to the growing body of evidence for the role for immunosuppressants in the management of peripartum cardiomyopathy.

"Introduction Nurse-patient communication is highly important especially when the patient is a child. One thing that has been overlooked in the nursing profession or less discussed is how to communicate with children. Design and training courses for the development of communication skills is considered as an important step in this direction. This study investigated the effect of training communication skills on children's nurses through role-playing. Materials and Methods This study is a clinical trial with pre-test and post-test which was done on 60 nurses in Dr. Sheikh Hospital in Mashhad-Iran. Nurses were randomly assigned into either intervention or control groups. Nurses' communication skills were measured using the tools of Calgary Cambridge communication skills assessment before and three weeks after the intervention. During one-day workshops, 6 hours of teaching communication skills with children were given to nurses as role playing and based on pre-prepared scenarios. Results The results showed there was no significant difference between the two groups in the mean score of nurses' verbal and non verbal communication skills before the intervention (verbal : P=0.302, non verbal : P=0.795). But after the intervention, the mean score of nurses' verbal and nonverbal communication skills in the experimental group were statistically significant and higher than those in the control group (P<0.001). Conclusion Now, due to the weakness in the relationship between nurse and child at the bedside and nurses also receive instruction on communication specific skills related to children, it seems essential that the effect of the implementation of various educational practices be examined to nurses' communication skills.

"In a cropped field, microclimate and thermal stability conditions depend on the canopy structures and the prevailing weather. The main aim of the study therefore was to characterize the vertical profiles of weather variables within and above a maize (Zea mays L.) canopy and to describe the water vapour pressure deficit (VPD) under different atmospheric and soil surface conditions for both wide and narrow runoff strips with the in-field rainwater harvesting (IRWH) system. Micrometeorological measurements of wind, temperature and relative humidity were performed at eight levels, within canopy (1.8 and 2.1 m), and just above the canopy (2.4, 2.7, 3.0, and 3.3 m) up to reference levels (3.9 and 4.5 m) when the maize reached a maximum height of 2.2 m. Under incomplete canopy cover of the IRWH system, two important factors complicated evapotranspiration estimation, namely the local advection and high temperatures of the bare soil between adjacent plant rows. Diurnal variations of water vapour related to turbulence at each locality and its position in the thermal internal boundary layers. Generally, advection was more pronounced in wide runoff strips than narrow strips. On wide runoff strips the wind was more effective in replacing the air between the rows and maintained a higher driving force for evaporation. The maximum VPD over the narrow strips was observed at reference level during a dry day, at about 2.2 kPa in the afternoon, while wet day VPD reached a maximum of 1.8 kPa. The VPD of the wide runoff strips correlated negatively with wind speed, but showed a fairly positive correlation with some scattered values on wet days after rain. Therefore, profile characteristics within and above plant canopies played a key role in determining the VPD and consequently, could help to explain transpiration rates of crops. Hence, VPD relations enhanced the understanding of the heat energy exchange processes under the heterogeneous nature of maize canopy of the IRWH tillage system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"This commentary argues that the recently approved contract under which the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is investing US$437 million dollars in Niger over the next five years, most of it on large-scale irrigation, is not a good investment. The paper explains why the programme is not likely to achieve the benefits anticipated. MCC had commissioned a detailed feasibility study, carried out by the authors of this paper, which strongly argued against investing in large-scale irrigation, in part because there is a poor track record for these investments in Niger, and in part because MCC has no comparative advantage in such investments. Instead, the feasibility study presented a strong case for investing in small-scale rainwater harvesting for agriculture and livestock at farm and watershed levels; and individualised small-scale irrigation for high-value nutritious crops and other water uses. The commentary concludes with suggestions on how the funds allocated for large-scale irrigation infrastructure (about US$250 million) could be reallocated to benefit a far larger number of people; and a recommendation that investors in African agricultural water management projects carry out an assessment of the performance and impacts of investment experiences over the past decade to identify lessons that could inform the next decade of investments in agricultural water management.

"Definitively identifying the cell type of newly generated cells in the heart and defining their origins are central questions in cardiac regenerative medicine. Currently, it is challenging to ascertain the myocardial identity and to track myocardial progeny during heart development and disease due to lack of proper genetic tools. This may lead to many misinterpretations of the findings in cardiac regenerative biology. In this study, we developed a set of novel mouse models by inserting double reporter genes nlacZ/H2B-GFP, mGFP/H2B-mCherry into the start codon of Tnnt2 and Myh6. nlacZ (nuclear lacZ) and mGFP (membrane GFP) are flanked by two LoxP sites in these animals. We found that the reporter genes faithfully recapitulated Tnnt2 and Myh6 cardiac expression from embryonic stage and adulthood. The reporter mice provide unprecedented robustness and fidelity for visualizing and tracing cardiomyocytes with nuclear or cell membrane localization signals. These animal models offer superior genetic tools to meet a critical need in studies of heart development, cardiac stem cell biology and cardiac regenerative medicine. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"Cardiomyocytes are prone to variations of the cell cycle, such as endoreduplication (continuing rounds of DNA synthesis without karyokinesis and cytokinesis) and acytokinetic mitosis (karyokinesis but no cytokinesis). Such atypical cell cycle variations result in polyploid and multinucleated cells rather than in cell division. Therefore, to determine cardiac turnover and regeneration, it is of crucial importance to correctly identify cardiomyocyte nuclei, the number of nuclei per cell, and their cell cycle status. This is especially true for the use of nuclear markers for identifying cell cycle activity, such as thymidine analogues Ki-67, PCNA, or pHH3. Here, we present methods for recognizing cardiomyocytes and their nuclearity and for determining their cell cycle activity. We use two published transgenic systems: the Myh6-H2B-mCh transgenic mouse line, for the unequivocal identification of cardiomyocyte nuclei, and the CAG-eGFP-anillin mouse line, for distinguishing cell division from cell cycle variations. Combined together, these two systems ease the study of cardiac regeneration and plasticity.

"Efficiency improvement is of great significance for simulation-driven antenna design optimization methods based on evolutionary algorithms (EAs). The two main efficiency enhancement methods exploit data-driven surrogate models and/or multi-fidelity simulation models to assist EAs. However, optimization methods based on the latter either need ad hoc low-fidelity model setup or have difficulties in handling problems with more than a few design variables, which is a main barrier for industrial applications. To address this issue, a generalized three stage multi-fidelity simulation -model assisted antenna design optimization framework is proposed in this paper. The main ideas include introduction of a novel data mining stage handling the discrepancy between simulation models of different fidelities, and a surrogate-model-assisted combined global and local search stage for efficient high-fidelity simulation model-based optimization. This framework is then applied to SADEA, which is a state-ofthe-art surrogate-model-assisted antenna design optimization method, constructing SADEA-II. Experimental results indicate that SADEA-II successfully handles various discrepancy between simulation models and considerably outperforms SADEA in terms of computational efficiency while ensuring improved design quality.

"The aim of this study was to assess the inter-rater variability of the visual interpretation of C-11-PiB PET images regarding the positivity/negativity of amyloid deposition that were obtained in a multicenter clinical research project, Japanese Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (J-ADNI). The results of visual interpretation were also compared with a semi-automatic quantitative analysis using mean cortical standardized uptake value ratio to the cerebellar cortex (mcSUVR). A total of 162 C-11-PiB PET scans, including 45 mild Alzheimer's disease, 60 mild cognitive impairment, and 57 normal cognitive control cases that had been acquired as J-ADNI baseline scans were analyzed. Based on visual interpretation by three independent raters followed by consensus read, each case was classified into positive, equivocal, and negative deposition (ternary criteria) and further dichotomized by merging the former two (binary criteria). Complete agreement of visual interpretation by the three raters was observed for 91.3% of the cases (Cohen kappa = 0.88 on average) in ternary criteria and for 92.3% (kappa = 0.89) in binary criteria. Cases that were interpreted as visually positive in the consensus read showed significantly higher mcSUVR than those visually negative (2.21 +/- 0.37 vs. 1.27 +/- 0.09, p < 0.001), and positive or negative decision by visual interpretation was dichotomized by a cut-off value of mcSUVR = 1.5. Significant positive/negative associations were observed between mcSUVR and the number of raters who evaluated as positive (rho = 0.87, p < 0.0001) and negative (rho = -0.85, p < 0.0001) interpretation. Cases of disagreement among raters showed generally low mcSUVR. Inter-rater agreement was almost perfect in C-11-PiB PET scans. Positive or negative decision by visual interpretation was dichotomized by a cut-off value of mcSUVR = 1.5. As some cases of disagreement among raters tended to show low mcSUVR, referring to quantitative method may facilitate correct diagnosis when evaluating images of low amyloid deposition.

"This work proposes a novel physics-based model for the fluid mechanics and heat transfer associated with slug flow boiling in horizontal circular microchannels to update the widely used three-zone model of Thome et al. (2004). The heat transfer model has a convective boiling nature and predicts the time dependent variation of the local heat transfer coefficient during the cyclic passage of a liquid slug, an evaporating elongated bubble and a vapor plug. The capillary flow theory, extended to incorporate evaporation effects, is applied to estimate the bubble velocity along the channel. A liquid film thickness prediction method also considering bubble proximity effects, which may limit the radial extension of the film, is included. The minimum liquid film thickness at dryout is set to the channel wall roughness. Theoretical heat transfer models accounting for the thermal inertia of the liquid film and for the recirculating flow within the liquid slug are utilized. The heat transfer model is compared to experimental data taken from three independent studies. The 833 slug flow boiling data points cover the fluids R134a, R245fa and R236fa, and channel diameters below 1 mm. The proposed evaporation model predicts more than 80% of the database to within +/- 30%. It demonstrates a stronger contribution to heat transfer by the liquid slugs and correspondingly less by the thin film evaporation process compared to the original three-zone model. This model represents a new step towards a complete physics-based modelling of the bubble dynamics and heat transfer within microchannels under evaporating flow conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

"As it provides the simultaneous benefits of reducing the demand for potable water and the generation of water runoff, rainwater harvesting (RWH) has received increasing attention from urban water managers in the past decades. This study employs a mass balance based method to estimate RWH performance for four large metropolitan areas of the United States, namely New York City, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Seattle. Geospatial analysis is used in concert with climatic records to characterize the cityscape and climatic patterns of each city and evaluate the RWH systems performance both in terms of potable water savings and roof runoff reductions. The analysis indicates that typical urban rainwater harvesting setups, consisting of a 100 m(2) roof connected to a 5m(3) storage volume, would be able to reduce potable water demand by over 65% in all cities while contextually reduce roof runoff generation by over 75%. Small differences in performance are observed among cities due to differences in precipitation patterns, typical roof area, and population density. Furthermore, an evaluation of the total water savings and runoff reduction for the application of RWH practices at maximum build out for all four study cities is provided, and the sensitivity of our estimates of performance to precipitation patterns and to the systems' operating algorithm is also analyzed and discussed.

"Although metagenomics is a relatively new scientific trend, it has managed to become popular in many countries, including Russia, over its 20-year history. This division of molecular genetics studies ecosystem-extracted nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), which contain full information about the microbial community of a habitat. Owing to metagenomic methods, soil microbiology has undertaken to study not only known cultivated types of microorganisms but also noncultivated forms, the biological properties of which can be suggested exclusively from the genetic information coded in their DNA. It turns out that such phantom types constitute the overwhelming majority within soil microbial communities; to all appearances, they actively participate in ensuring soil fertility, and, hence, in the opinion of the authors of this paper, study of them is topical for both basic research and agricultural practice. The development of metagenomic technologies will help understand biological phenomena determined by close plant-microbe interactions, such as increasing the productivity of agricultural crops and protecting them against phytopathogens. However, the introduction of new methods has always presented difficulties; in metagenomics, they are associated with the acquisition, storage, and bioinformational analysis of a huge array of genetic information.

"Airway exposure of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is shown to regulate type I and type II helper T cell induced asthma. While high doses of LPS derive Th1- or Th17-immune responses, low LPS levels lead to Th2 responses. In this paper, we analyze a mathematical model of Thl/Th2/Th17 asthma regulation suggested by Lee et al. (S. Lee, H.T. Hwang, and Y. Kim, Modeling the role of TGF-8 in regulation of the Th17 phenotype in the LPS-driven immune system, Bull Math Biol., 76 (5), 1045-1080, 2014) and show that the system can undergo a Hopf bifurcation at a steady state of the Th17 phenotype for high LPS levels in the presence of time delays in inhibition pathways of two key regulators: IL-4/Th2 activities (H) and TCF-beta levels (G). The time delays affect the phenotypic switches among the Thl, Th2, and Th17 phenotypes in response to time-dependent LPS doses via nonlinear crosstalk between H and G. An extended reaction-diffusion model also predicts coexistence of these phenotypes under various biochemical and bio-mechanical conditions in the heterogeneous microenvironment.

"This paper presents a power electronic converter used to redistribute the power among the phases in unbalanced power systems, which is supposed to be designed based on the involved degree of unbalance. A bidirectional converter is chosen for this purpose, whose modeling is presented in the dq0 system. This solution can be considered as part of a unified control system, where conventional active power filters may be solely responsible for compensating harmonics and/or the tuning of passive filters becomes easier, with consequent reduction in involved costs in a decentralized approach. The adopted control strategy is implemented in digital signal processor TMS320F2812, while experimental results obtained from an experimental prototype rated at 17.86 kVA are properly discussed considering that the converter is placed at the secondary side of a transformer supplying three distinct single-phase loads. It is effectively shown that the converter is able to balance the currents in the transformer phases, thus leading to the suppression of the neutral current.

"Does liking a brand on Facebook cause a person to view it more favorably? Or is liking simply a symptom of being fond of a brand? The authors disentangle these possibilities and find evidence for the latter: brand attitudes and purchasing are predicted by consumers' preexisting fondness for brands, and these are the same regardless of when and whether consumers like brands on social media. In addition, we explore possible second-order effects by examining whether liking brands might cause consumers' friends to view that brand more favorably. When consumers see that a friend has liked a brand, they are less likely to buy the brand relative to when they learn that a friend genuinely likes the brand in the offline sense, which is a more meaningful social endorsement. Taken together, five experiments and two meta-analyses (N >14,000) suggest that turning liking into improved brand attitudes and increased purchasing by consumers and their friends may require more than just the click of a button.

"This work evaluates for the first time the cyto-compatibility of silicone (polysiloxane)/bioactive glass composite films produced by dip coating on stainless steel substrates using osteoblast-like (MG-63) cells. With the aim of creating corrosion resistant coatings for biomedical applications, bioactive glass (BG) of 45S5 composition was used as a filler in conjunction with commercial silicones (MK and H62C). Bioactive glass has the property of forming a direct bond to living bone, and polysiloxane is an attractive candidate for protective coatings due to its resistance to oxidation and corrosion. Suspensions based on polysiloxanes (MK/H62C) and micro-sized BG fillers were used for dip coating stainless steel substrates at room temperature, followed by curing in oxidative atmosphere at 260 degrees C and 500 degrees C. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis revealed the presence of Si-O-Si, Si-OR, Si-CH3 and Si-OH groups on the substrate. Field emission scanning electron microscopy showed that the coatings were homogeneous with no obvious cracks or pinholes at relatively high concentrations of both polysiloxane and BG. The cell biology experiments confirmed that the expressed cell-morphology, analyzed on chosen surfaces, was pheno-typical for MG-63 cells after 48 h of incubation. On the film containing the lower amount of polysiloxane/BG the most dense cell layer was formed. Our results indicated that polysiloxane/BG composite films exhibited good cyto-compatibility at 260 degrees C and 500 degrees C and showed no toxicity toward MG-63 cells suggesting the potential of this composite for applications in medical implants.

"Is family structure a cue for stereotyping? Past reviews on the topic of stereotypes and parenthood are divided. To update the current understanding on this important question, this systematic review summarizes and integrates the body of literature published between 2003 and 2013 on stereotypes associated with married, divorced, single, step, same-sex and adoptive parents. Seventeen articles met all of the inclusion criteria. An analysis of the final sample of studies helps main trends pertaining to these six parental types to be identified. Findings revealed that motherhood and fatherhood continue to be conceptualized differently, with stereotypes associated with different types of fathers appearing more positive than those associated with different types of mothers. Married parents also appear to remain the parental type that is the most positively stereotyped and against which other types are compared. These results are compared to past meta-analytic reviews and implications for future research are presented.

"Psoriasis can be managed successfully with long-term biologics. Real-life clinical practice may require dose tapering as a therapeutic option to reduce the risk of drug-exposure and to increase cost-effectiveness. The responsiveness to extended intervals between adalimumab doses and the possible predictive factors of maintenance of complete clearance were studied in a retrospective 7-year single-centre analysis. Thirty patients who achieved complete clearance with adalimumab underwent dose tapering, progressively extending between-dose intervals (to 21-28 days). Sixty percent of subjects (group A) maintained complete clearance, whereas 40.0% (group B) relapsed and were switched back to the standard dosage to re-achieve complete clearance. Body mass index (BMI) and time to achieve Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI-100) with adalimumab standard treatment before dose tapering were significantly lower in group A than in group B (multivariate Cox regression: p < 0.05, Kaplan-Meier analysis: p < 0.001, respectively). This study suggests that patients with lower BMI and shorter time to achieve PASI-100 with adalimumab standard dose were significantly more likely to be candidates for dose tapering.

"Breast cancer is the most common invasive cancer among women and its incidence is increasing. Risk assessment is valuable and recent methods are incorporating novel biomarkers such as mammographic density. Artificial neural networks (ANN) are adaptive algorithms capable of performing pattern-to-pattern learning and are well suited for medical applications. They are potentially useful for calibrating full-field digital mammography (FFDM) for quantitative analysis. This study uses ANN modeling to estimate volumetric breast density (VBD) from FFDM on Japanese women with and without breast cancer. ANN calibration of VBD was performed using phantom data for one FFDM system. Mammograms of 46 Japanese women diagnosed with invasive carcinoma and 53 with negative findings were analyzed using ANN models learned. ANN-estimated VBD was validated against phantom data, compared intra-patient, with qualitative composition scoring, with MRI VBD, and inter-patient with classical risk factors of breast cancer as well as cancer status. Phantom validations reached an R (2) of 0.993. Intra-patient validations ranged from R (2) of 0.789 with VBD to 0.908 with breast volume. ANN VBD agreed well with BI-RADS scoring and MRI VBD with R (2) ranging from 0.665 with VBD to 0.852 with breast volume. VBD was significantly higher in women with cancer. Associations with age, BMI, menopause, and cancer status previously reported were also confirmed. ANN modeling appears to produce reasonable measures of mammographic density validated with phantoms, with existing measures of breast density, and with classical biomarkers of breast cancer. FFDM VBD is significantly higher in Japanese women with cancer.

Our aims were: (i) to determine whether hybridisation or introgression occurs between Emys orbicularis subspecies in a natural contact zone in France; (ii) to determine the geographic extent of the contact zone between distinct subspecies in France; (iii) to evaluate at which level introgression occurs, and finally; (iv) to evaluate whether combining mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers reflects the same contact zone as when only one genetic marker is used. Introgression was evaluated by genotyping biparentally inherited microsatellites and sequencing the maternally inherited cytochrome b gene of French populations. We demonstrated strong introgression between subspecies under natural conditions in the old contact zone in southern and eastern France. Our results corroborated that introgression reflects past natural events, but also demonstrated that human impact has altered these patterns. We finally confirmed that the combination of mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers is more appropriate to reveal introgression than the use of only one genetic marker.

"Electrocoagulation is an effective electrochemical approach for the treatment of different types of contaminated water and has received considerable attention in recent years due its high efficiency in dealing with numerous stubborn pollutants. It has been successful in dealing with Organic and inorganic contaminants with negligible or almost no generation of by-product wastes. During the past decade, vast amount of research has been devoted to utilizing electrocoagulation for the treatment of several types of wastewater, ranging from polluted groundwater to highly contaminated refinery wastewater. This paper offers a comprehensive review of recent literature that has been dedicated to utilizing electrocoagulation for water treatment, focusing on current successes on specific applications in water and wastewater treatment, as well as potentials for future applications. The paper examines such aspects as theory, potential applications, current challenges, recent developments as well as economical concerns associated with the technology. Most of the recent EC research has been focusing on pollutant-specific evaluation without paying attention to cell design, process modeling or industrial applications. This review attempts to highlight the main achievements in the area and outlines the major shortcomings with recommendations for promising research options that can enhance the technology and broaden its range of applications.

"Region-based hierarchical image representation is crucial in many computer vision applications. However, in practice, an image hierarchy is usually dense, and contains many less informative branches. It is expected that a hierarchy should be accurate and simplified, which is not only desirable for different applications, but also saves considerable computational load for the further analysis. To achieve this target, this paper proposes a novel approach for unsupervised simplification of region-based image hierarchies, which employs the global and local evolution analyses of a hierarchy. First, we introduce a global evolution analysis in the scale-sets framework, which provides clues for eliminating less informative branches. Moreover, a hybrid unsupervised simplification method is designed, utilizing the information from global and local evolution functions. A number of experiments on various images have shown that the proposed approach is effective and efficient in removing less informative nodes (averagely about 90% of the whole nodes), while preserving salient image details and retaining the accuracy.

"Remote sensing applications in water resources management are becoming an essential asset in all different levels of integrated water rational use. Due to remote sensing data availability and different acquisition sensors of satellite images, a wide variability of benchmarks could be conducted under the same theme. Rainwater harvesting is the branch of science where the rainwater is the main target to improve groundwater recharge, stratocumulus clouds are the main source of rain in arid regions. Cloud detection using remote sensing techniques proved to be efficient recently but the general uses of different cloud detection techniques are to precisely omit clouds from satellite images. The use of cloud detection scheme described herein is designed for the MERIS Level1B data; therefore, total set of 60 MERIS images was collected on monthly basis for 5 years started from January 2008. The use of the cloud detection algorithm is to find proper land cover suitable for rainwater harvesting mostly covered with cloud all over the year. Evaluation of land use for rainwater harvesting in terms of groundwater recharge is considered, several factors were taken into consideration and NDWI is one of the most important factors involved. Results pointed out that some regions in southern Saudi Arabia are qualified enough to be considered as potential sites for better rainwater harvesting.

"Background. The use of electronic health records (EHRs) in dental care and their effect on dental care provider-patient interaction have not been studied sufficiently. The authors conducted a study to explore dental care providers' interactions with EHRs during patient visits, how these interactions influence dental care provider-patient communication, and the providers' and patients' perception of EHR use in the dental clinic setting during patient visits. Methods. The authors collected survey and interview data from patients and providers at three dental clinics in a health care system. The authors used qualitative and quantitative methods to analyze data obtained from patients and dental care providers. Results. The provider survey results showed significant differences in perceptions of EHR use in patient visits across dental care provider groups (dentists, dental hygienists and dental assistants). Patient survey results indicated that some patients experienced a certain level of frustration and distraction because of providers' use of EHRs during the visit. Conclusions. The provider survey results indicated that there are different perceptions across provider groups about EHRs and the effect of computer use on communication with patients. Dental assistants generally reported more negative effects on communication with patients owing to computer use. Interview results also indicated that dental care providers may not feel comfortable interacting with the EHR without having any verbal or eye contact with patients during the patient's dental visit. Practical Implications. A new design for dental operatories and locations of computer screens within the operatories should be undertaken to prevent negative nonverbal communication such as loss of eye contact or forcing the provider and patient to sit back to back, as well as to enhance patient education and information sharing.

"The past two decades of growth in renewable energy sources of electricity (RES-E) have been largely driven by out-of-market support policies. These schemes were designed to drive deployment on the basis of specific subsidies sustained in time to allow for the larger costs as well as to limit investor risk. While these policies have proven to be effective, the way they have been designed to date has led to costly market distortions that are becoming more difficult to ignore as penetrations reach unpreceded levels. In the context of this growing concern, we provide a critical analysis of the design elements of RES-E support schemes, focusing on how they affect this trade-off between promoting and efficiently integrating RES-E. The emphasis is on the structure of the incentive payment, which in the end turns to be the cornerstone for an efficient integration. We conclude that, while needed, a well-designed and further developed capacity-based support mechanism complemented with ex-post compensations defined for reference benchmark plants, such as the mechanism currently implemented in Spain, is an alternative with good properties if the major goal is truly market integration. The approach is robust to future developments in technology cost, performance and market penetration of RES-E.

"Lithium diphosphate glasses doped MgO was prepared via a melt quenching technique. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman and impedance spectroscopy. XRD spectra reflected the amorphous nature of the glasses Raman spectra show structural network modifications with the composition variations of the studied glasses. Raman spectra of the studied glasses contain also typical phosphate glasses bands. Thus the band at similar to 698 cm(-1) assigned to symmetric stretching vibrations of P-O-P groups and that from similar to 1168 cm(-1) is attributed to symmetric stretching motions of the non-bridging oxygen (NBO) atoms bonded to phosphorous atoms (PO2) in phosphate tetrahedron. Electric properties were investigated using complex impedance spectroscopy in a frequency range from 40 Hz to 6 MHz at room temperature. The impedance spectra were analyzed in terms of equivalent circuits involving resistors, capacitors and constant phase elements (CPE). Constant-phase elements (CPE) are used in equivalent electrical circuits for the fitting of experimental impedance data. The AC conductivity exhibited a Jonscher's universal power law according with the relation sigma(omega)) = sigma(0) + A omega(s) and it is observed that as the MgO content increases, frequency exponent (s) decreases.

"Sleep impairment significantly alters human brain structure and cognitive function, but available evidence suggests that adults in developed nations are sleeping less. A growing body of research has sought to use sleep to forecast cognitive performance by modeling the relationship between the two, but has generally focused on vigilance rather than other cognitive constructs affected by sleep, such as reaction time, executive function, and working memory. Previous modeling efforts have also utilized subjective, self-reported sleep durations and were restricted to laboratory environments. In the current effort, we addressed these limitations by employing wearable systems and mobile applications to gather objective sleep information, assess multi-construct cognitive performance, and model/predict changes to mental acuity. Thirty participants were recruited for participation in the study, which lasted 1 week. Using the Fitbit Charge HR and a mobile version of the automated neuropsychological assessment metric called CogGauge, we gathered a series of features and utilized the unified model of performance to predict mental acuity based on sleep records. Our results suggest that individuals poorly rate their sleep duration, supporting the need for objective sleep metrics to model circadian changes to mental acuity. Participant compliance in using the wearable throughout the week and responding to the CogGauge assessments was 80%. Specific biases were identified in temporal metrics across mobile devices and operating systems and were excluded from the mental acuity metric development. Individualized prediction of mental acuity consistently outperformed group modeling. This effort indicates the feasibility of creating an individualized, mobile assessment and prediction of mental acuity, compatible with the majority of current mobile devices.

"The field of stem cell biology, cell therapy, and regenerative medicine has expanded almost exponentially, in the last decade. Clinical trials are evaluating the potential therapeutic use of stem cells in many adult and pediatric lung diseases with vascular component, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), or pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Extensive research activity is exploring the lung resident and circulating progenitor cells and their contribution to vascular complications of chronic lung diseases, and researchers hope to use resident or circulating stem/progenitor cells to treat chronic lung diseases and their vascular complications. It is becoming more and more clear that progress in mechanobiology will help to understand the various influences of physical forces and extracellular matrix composition on the phenotype and features of the progenitor cells and stem cells.

"Hexamoll(A (R)) DINCHA (R) (diisononyl-cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylate) is a new high-molecular-weight plasticizer and a phthalate substitute. In this study, the metabolism of DINCHA (R) was investigated by oral dosage of three male volunteers with approximately 50 mg Hexamoll(A (R)) DINCHA (R) (resulting in individual doses between 0.552 and 0.606 mg/kg body weight). Their urine samples were consecutively collected over 48 h. In analogy to di-iso-nonylphthalate (DINP) metabolism, we quantified the simple monoester mono-isononyl-cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylate (MINCH) and its secondary oxidized metabolites with HPLC-MS/MS via isotope dilution analysis. Additionally, we quantified the unspecific full breakdown product, cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid (CHDA), via standard addition. All postulated metabolites were present in all samples analyzed. The unspecific CHDA was identified as the major urinary metabolite representing 23.7 % of the dose as the mean of the three volunteers (range 20.0-26.5 %). 14.8 % (11.3-16.7 %) of the dose was excreted as monoesters with oxidative modifications, in particular OH-MINCH 10.7 % (7.7-12.9 %), oxo-MINCH 2.0 % (1.5-2.6 %) and carboxy-MINCH 2.0 % (1.8-2.3 %). Less than 1 % was excreted as the simple monoester MINCH. In sum, 39.2 % (35.9-42.4 %) of the DINCHA (R) dose was excreted as these metabolites in urine within 48 h. Over 90 % of the metabolites investigated were excreted within 24 h after application. The secondary oxidized metabolites, with elimination half-times between 10 and 18 h, proved to be apt and specific biomarkers to determine DINCHA (R) exposure. With this study, we provide reliable urinary excretion factors to calculate DINCHA (R) intakes based on these metabolites in environmental and occupational studies.

"Although single-center and cross-sectional studies have suggested a modest impact of liver donation on donor psychological well-being, few studies have assessed these outcomes prospectively among a large cohort. We conducted one of the largest, prospective, multicenter studies of psychological outcomes in living liver donors within the Adult-to-Adult Living Donor Liver Transplantation Cohort Study2 (A2ALL-2) consortium. In total, 271 (91%) of 297 eligible donors were interviewed at least once before donation and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 mo after donation using validated measures. We found that living liver donors reported low rates of major depressive (0-3%), alcohol abuse (2-5%), and anxiety syndromes (2-3%) at any given assessment in their first 2 years after donation. Between 4.7% and 9.6% of donors reported impaired mental well-being at various time points. We identified significant predictors for donors' perceptions of being better people and experiencing psychological growth following donation, including age, sex, relationship to recipient, ambivalence and motivation regarding donation, and feeling that donation would make life more worthwhile. Our results highlight the need for close psychosocial monitoring for those donors whose recipients died (n=27); some of those donors experienced guilt and concerns about responsibility. Careful screening and targeted, data-driven follow-up hold promise for optimizing psychological outcomes following this procedure for potentially vulnerable donors. A prospective study of living liver donors across nine transplant centers shows low rates of major depressive, alcohol abuse, and anxiety syndromes, though some donors (such as those whose recipients die) may benefit from close psychosocial monitoring.

"Ambient intelligence is an emerging platform that provides advances in sensors and sensor networks, pervasive computing, and artificial intelligence to capture the real time climate data. This result continuously generates several exabytes of unstructured sensor data and so it is often called big climate data. Nowadays, researchers are trying to use big climate data to monitor and predict the climate change and possible diseases. Traditional data processing techniques and tools are not capable of handling such huge amount of climate data. Hence, there is a need to develop advanced big data architecture for processing the real time climate data. The purpose of this paper is to propose a big data based surveillance system that analyzes spatial climate big data and performs continuous monitoring of correlation between climate change and Dengue. Proposed disease surveillance system has been implemented with the help of Apache Hadoop MapReduce and its supporting tools.

"Context: Patients with schizophrenia display abnormalities in pitch discrimination of non-verbal tones as revealed by the Tone-Matching Task (TMT). It may lead to deficits in higher-order cognitive functions and clinical symptoms. Objectives: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis pooling data about TMT score differences between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls, to evaluate the deficit's effect size, and to develop reliable knowledge about pitch processing impairment and its pejorative impact. Method: Relevant publications were identified by a systematic search of PubMed and EMBASE databases. Then, we excluded non-relevant studies for the meta-analysis. Effect size for percent of correct responses to the TMT was expressed as standardized mean difference (SMD). Results: Eighteen of 167 identified studies met eligibility criteria for review, of which 10 were included in the meta-analysis. Our meta-analysis showed that the effect size for the percent of correct response to the TMT between patients (N=371) and controls (N=342) was large: SMD=1.17 [95% CI: 0.926-1.418] (z-value=9.338 and p-value = 0.001). Meta-analysis showed moderate heterogeneity between studies (Q(9)=17.22, p=0.04, I-2=47.74%). The relationship between tone-matching impairment and clinical symptoms of schizophrenia remains heterogeneous across studies. Some authors observed significant correlations between tone-matching performance and a number of higher-order cognitive abilities. Conclusion: This review and meta-analysis highlights a large significant disturbance in tone-matching ability in patients as compared with controls. The study of basic auditory processing opens promising perspectives for pathophysiological modelling of the disorder and therapeutic issues. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

It is embedding computers in our daily lives to create an active and intelligent environment [1]. This is future phase of computers, which is beyond the desktop and notebook environment, where we are currently in and we are progressively heading deeper inside this new phase. In Ubiquitous Computing we mainly focus on computer being integral part of human such that we are unaware of their presence. Computer scientists are focusing hard on ways how the interaction between human and computer can be simplified. We can think of an era where we are surrounded with over hundreds of computers each doing a unique task irrespective of location and time and keeping human unaware. In this article we explore about the evolution of ubiquitous computing from its origin and history, its architecture, role of privacy and integration of privacy in system design, its Features and Technical Challenges. Ubiquitous computing is the third wave in computing, which has begun just now. Ubicomp is a field where we require considerable efforts to match up the current technological developments.

"Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data classification provides useful thematic maps for numerous geospatial applications. Several methods and algorithms have been proposed recently for LiDAR data classification. Most studies focused on object-based analysis because of its advantages over per-pixel-based methods. However, several issues, such as parameter optimization, attribute selection, and development of transferable rulesets, remain challenging in this topic. This study contributes to LiDAR data classification by developing an approach that integrates ant colony optimization (ACO) and rule-based classification. First, LiDAR-derived digital elevation and digital surface models were integrated with high-resolution orthophotos. Second, the processed raster was segmented with the multiresolution segmentation method. Subsequently, the parameters were optimized with a supervised technique based on fuzzy analysis. A total of 20 attributes were selected based on general knowledge on the study area and LiDAR data; the best subset containing 12 attributes was then selected via ACO. These attributes were utilized to develop rulesets through the use of a decision tree algorithm, and a thematic map was generated for the study area. Results revealed the robustness of the proposed method, which has an overall accuracy of similar to 95% and a kappa coefficient of 0.94. The rule-based approach with all attributes and the k nearest neighbor (KNN) classification method were applied to validate the results of the proposed method. The overall accuracy of the rule-based method with all attributes was similar to 88% (kappa = 0.82), whereas the KNN method had an overall accuracy of <70% and produced a poor thematic map. The selection of the ACO algorithm was justified through a comparison with three well-known feature selection methods. On the other hand, the transferability of the developed rules was evaluated by using a second LiDAR dataset at another study area. The overall accuracy and the kappa index for the second study area were 92% and 0.90, respectively. Overall, the findings indicate that the selection of a subset with significant attributes is important for accurate LiDAR data classification with object-based methods.

"Convolutional neural network (CNN), a well-known machine learning algorithm, has been widely used in the field of computer vision for its amazing performance in image classification. With the rapid growth of applications based on CNN, various acceleration schemes have been proposed on FPGA, GPU and ASIC. In the implementation of these specific hardware accelerations, the most challenging part is the implementation of 2D convolution. To obtain a more efficient design of 2D convolution in CNN, this paper proposes a novel technique, singular value decomposition approximation (SVDA) to reduce the usage of resources. Experimental results show that the proposed SVDA hardware implementation can achieve a reduction in resources in the range of 14.46% to 37.8%, while the loss of classification accuracy is less than 1%.

Even though III-V semiconductor-based RF PAs can still offer superior frequency and breakdown performance with higher POUT and power-added-efficiency (PAE) and faster time-to-market, silicon-based RF PAs do have the advantages in offering higher monolithic integration with added functionalities (e.g., on-chip digital control and selection on power level, modulation, frequency band, matching, predistortion, etc.), which can translate to lower cost and smaller sizes attractive for broadband multi-mode multi-band handset transmitters. Therefore, some key techniques for designing high-efficiency 4G/5G/WLAN broadband wireless silicon PAs will be discussed.

"Vast majority of practical engineering design problems require simultaneous handling of several criteria. For the sake of simplicity and through a priori preference articulation one can turn many design tasks into single-objective problems that can be handled using conventional numerical optimization routines. However, in some situations, acquiring comprehensive knowledge about the system at hand, in particular, about possible trade-offs between conflicting objectives may be necessary. This calls for multi objective optimization that aims at identifying a set of alternative, Pareto-optimal designs. The most popular solution approaches include population-based metaheuristics. Unfortunately, such methods are not practical for problems involving expensive computational models. This is particularly the case for microwave and antenna engineering where design reliability requires utilization of CPU-intensive electromagnetic (EM) analysis. In this work, we discuss methodologies for expedited multi-objective design optimization of expensive EM simulation models. The solution approaches that we present here rely on surrogate-based optimization (SBO) paradigm, where the design speedup is obtained by shifting the optimization burden into a cheap replacement model (the surrogate). The latter is utilized for generating the initial approximation of the Pareto front representation as well as further front refinement (to elevate it to the high-fidelity EM simulation model level). We demonstrate several application case studies, including a wideband matching transformer, a dielectric resonator antenna and an ultra-wideband monopole antenna. Dimensionality of the design spaces in the considered examples vary from six to fifteen, and the design optimization cost is about one hundred of high-fidelity EM simulations of the respective structure, which is extremely low given the problem complexity.

"Although total hip replacement (THR) has been proven to be effective, the effect of THR on employment in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in Chinese population is still unknown. We aimed to demonstrate whether or not patients with AS returned to work following THR and factors associated with the work ability after THR. We performed a retrospective study including a total number of 128 AS patients undergoing THR between 2009 and 2013. Presurgery and postsurgery data including disease state, work status, type of job, and time of resuming work were collected. Factors associated with early return to work were assessed through ordinal regression. Eighty-seven of 128 patients (68 %) were employed within 1 year before THR and 98 returned to work after surgery. Among them, 21, 46, and 31 resumed work by 3, 6, and 12 months postoperation, respectively. Multivariate ordinal regression showed that patients with unilateral THR, younger age, lower BASFI score, employed presurgery, and low or moderate physical demand were more likely to resume work earlier. Most individuals working presurgery returned to work after THR. For young AS patients with hip involvement, THR is an effective treatment for improving and maintaining work ability.

"Phenotyping is important to understand plant biology, but current solutions are costly, not versatile or are difficult to deploy. To solve this problem, we present Phenotiki, an affordable system for plant phenotyping that, relying on off-the-shelf parts, provides an easy to install and maintain platform, offering an out-of-box experience for a well-established phenotyping need: imaging rosette-shaped plants. The accompanying software (with available source code) processes data originating from our device seamlessly and automatically. Our software relies on machine learning to devise robust algorithms, and includes an automated leaf count obtained from 2D images without the need of depth (3D). Our affordable device ((sic)200) can be deployed in growth chambers or greenhouse to acquire optical 2D images of approximately up to 60 adult Arabidopsis rosettes concurrently. Data from the device are processed remotely on a workstation or via a cloud application (based on CyVerse). In this paper, we present a proof-of-concept validation experiment on top-view images of 24 Arabidopsis plants in a combination of genotypes that has not been compared previously. Phenotypic analysis with respect to morphology, growth, color and leaf count has not been performed comprehensively before now. We confirm the findings of others on some of the extracted traits, showing that we can phenotype at reduced cost. We also perform extensive validations with external measurements and with higher fidelity equipment, and find no loss in statistical accuracy when we use the affordable setting that we propose. Device set-up instructions and analysis software are publicly available (http://phenotiki.com).

"Trust management has become an emerging security paradigm in various areas such as ad hoc networks and cloud computing. One core element of trust management is the indirect trust model that evaluates the trustworthiness of a target based on others' recommendations. The research on indirect trust is still at an early stage, and some problems are not addressed yet. Because of the subjectivity of trust, entities would have different views on a same target. Consequently, after receiving recommendations, the evaluating entity should first measure their credibility. Existing methods often distort recommendations. We propose a more reasonable method based on the similarity between recommenders and evaluating entities. Furthermore, considering the characteristics of one-hop and multi-hop recommendations, the similarity calculation methods for them were developed individually. Another problem is the spoofed recommendations aiming at tarnishing someone or harboring conspirators. We design a simple but efficient algorithm to detect and remove them. The proposed methods and algorithms constitute the integrated indirect trust model. This model is not bound to any specific domain, and thus it can be widely applied. Simulation results show that the model is effective in obtaining an objective indirect trust value with the existence of personalized and dishonest recommenders.

"General, spontaneous evaluations of strangers based on their faces have been shown to reflect judgments of these persons' intention and ability to harm. These evaluations can be mapped onto a 2D space defined by the dimensions trustworthiness (intention) and dominance (ability). Here we go beyond general evaluations and focus on more specific personality judgments derived from the Big Two and Big Five personality concepts. In particular, we investigate whether Big Two/Big Five personality judgments can be mapped onto the 2D space defined by the dimensions trustworthiness and dominance. Results indicate that judgments of the Big Two personality dimensions almost perfectly map onto the 2D space. In contrast, at least 3 of the Big Five dimensions (i.e., neuroticism, extraversion, and conscientiousness) go beyond the 2D space, indicating that additional dimensions are necessary to describe more specific face-based personality judgments accurately. Building on this evidence, we model the Big Two/Big Five personality dimensions in real facial photographs. Results from 2 validation studies show that the Big Two/Big Five are perceived reliably across different samples of faces and participants. Moreover, results reveal that participants differentiate reliably between the different Big Two/Big Five dimensions. Importantly, this high level of agreement and differentiation in personality judgments from faces likely creates a subjective reality which may have serious consequences for those being perceived-notably, these consequences ensue because the subjective reality is socially shared, irrespective of the judgments' validity. The methodological approach introduced here might prove useful in various psychological disciplines.

"Increased enterococcal infections in hospitals and multidrug-resistant and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) isolated from humans, animals, and food sources raised public health concern on the presence of VRE in multiple sources. We performed a comparative analysis of the antimicrobial resistance and genetics of VRE isolates derived from fresh produce and human fecal samples. Of 389 Enterococcus isolates, 8 fecal and 3 produce isolates were resistant to vancomycin and teicoplanin; all harbored vanA gene. The VRE isolates showed multidrug-resistant properties. The isolates from fresh produce in this study showed to have the common shared characteristics with the isolates from humans by the results of antimicrobial resistance, multilocus sequence typing, and Tn 1546 transposon analysis. Therefore, VRE isolates from fresh produce are likely related to VRE derived from humans. The results suggested that VRE may contaminate vegetables through the environment, and the contaminated vegetables could then act as a vehicle for human infections. Ongoing nationwide surveillance of antibiotic resistance and the promotion of the proper use of antibiotics are necessary.

"In this work, a novel four-terminal perovskite/SiC-based rear contact silicon tandem solar cell device has been proposed and simulated to achieve 27.6% power conversion efficiency (PCE) under single AM1.5 illumination. 20.9% efficient semitransparent perovskite top subcell has been used for perovskite/silicon tandem architecture. The tandem structure of perovskite-silicon solar cells is a promising method to achieve efficient solar energy conversion at low cost. In the four-terminal tandem configuration, the cells are connected independently and hence avoids the need for current matching between top and bottom subcell, thus giving greater design flexibility. The simulation analysis shows, PCE of 27.6% and 22.4% with 300 mu m and 10 pm thick rear contact Si bottom subcell, respectively. This is a substantial improvement comparing to transparent perovskite solar cell and c-Si solar cell operated individually. The impact of perovskite layer thickness, monomolecular, bimolecular, and trimolecular recombination have also been obtained on the performance of perovskite top subcell. Reported PCEs of 27.6% and 22.4% are 1.25 times and 1.42 times higher as compared to experimentally available efficiencies of 22.1% and 15.7% in 300 gm and 10 mu m thick stand-alone silicon solar cell devices, respectively. The presence of SiC significantly suppressed the interface recombination in bottom silicon subcell. Detailed realistic technology computer aided design (TCAD) analysis has been performed to predict the behaviour of the device. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"Secure data aggregation (SDA) schemes are widely used in distributed applications, such as mobile sensor networks, to reduce communication cost, prolong the network life cycle and provide security. However, most SDA are only suited for a single type of statistics (i.e., summation-based or comparison-based statistics) and are not applicable to obtaining multiple statistic results. Most SDA are also inefficient for dynamic networks. This paper presents multi-functional secure data aggregation (MFSDA), in which the mapping step and coding step are introduced to provide value-preserving and order-preserving and, later, to enable arbitrary statistics support in the same query. MFSDA is suited for dynamic networks because these active nodes can be counted directly from aggregation data. The proposed scheme is tolerant to many types of attacks. The network load of the proposed scheme is balanced, and no significant bottleneck exists. The MFSDA includes two versions: MFSDA-I and MFSDA-II. The first one can obtain accurate results, while the second one is a more generalized version that can significantly reduce network traffic at the expense of less accuracy loss.

"Previous work shows that children view group membership and psychological traits in essentialist terms, perceiving them to be both biologically determined and stable across time. To what extent might individuals view mental states such as beliefs similarly? Given that beliefs are often based on experience and can change across time, one hypothesis is that beliefs on the whole do not elicit essentialism. An alternative hypothesis, however, is that some beliefs may be perceived as inherited and stable over time characteristics associated with essentialism. In three studies, we examined two aspects of psychological essentialism regarding three different types of beliefs (religious beliefs, factual beliefs, and opinions) in 8- to 10-year-old children and adults, asking whether beliefs are seen as (a) biologically based and/or (b) stable across time. Both children and adults distinguished among belief types when considering biology; opinions were perceived to be more rooted in biology than were other beliefs. By contrast, fewer consistent differences emerged when children and adults considered stability. For example, both children and adults perceived opinions and factual beliefs to be equally changeable. Finally, although children typically perceived beliefs to be more rooted in biology than adults, more specific patterns across belief types (e.g., perceiving opinions to be more rooted in biology than religious beliefs) remained relatively stable across age groups. Thus, development and social learning may play a larger role in perceptions of the biological component of essentialism than in judgments of particular beliefs. We discuss implications for literatures on essentialism, religious cognition, and social cognitive development. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

"Employers and mainly those the operate in an international context and interact in a multicultural environment want and look for employees who possess emotional competences, which influence and ease relationships between people, allow a better social cohesion, an emotional self-control and an alphabetisation of emotional states, and who work together for their personal benefit and not contrary to their expectations, needs and competences. An increasing number of specialists state that emotional intelligence is a central variable that affects leaders' performance. In this study, carried out in a sugar factory, we tried to characterise the internal environment of the organisation and the relationships that dominate them in order to identify and understand the situation the organisation is confronted with in terms of the relationship between managers and subordinates, empathy, nonverbal communication, self-control, handling relationships, emotional intelligence. We tried to provide exploratory evidence for the effects that emotional intelligence has on leaders and followers in terms of performance, results and work satisfaction. (C) 2014 The Authors.

"The triggers for the onset of oral diseases are still poorly understood. The aim of this study was to characterize the oral bacterial community in healthy humans and its association with nutrition, oral hygiene habits, and the release of the inflammatory marker IL-8 from gingival epithelial cells (GECs) with and without stimulation by bacterial endotoxins to identify possible indicator operational taxonomic units (OTUs) associated with inflammatory marker status. GECs from 21 healthy participants (13 females, 8 males) were incubated with or without addition of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), and the oral microbiota was profiled using 16S rRNA gene-targeted sequencing. The basal IL-8 release after 6 h was between 9.9 and 98.2 pg/ml, and bacterial communities were characteristic for healthy oral microbiota. The composition of the oral microbiota was associated with basal IL-8 levels, the intake of meat, tea, white wine, sweets and the use of chewing gum, as well as flossing habits, allergies, gender and body mass index. Additionally, eight OTUs were associated with high basal levels of IL-8 and GEC response to LPS, with high basal levels of IL-8, and 1 with low basal levels of IL8. The identification of indicator bacteria in healthy subjects with high levels of IL-8 release is of importance as they may be promising early warning indicators for the possible onset of oral diseases.

"Smart environments possess devices that collaborate to help the user non-intrusively. One possible aid smart environment offer is to anticipate user's tasks and perform them on his/her behalf or facilitate the action completion. In this paper, we propose a framework that predicts user's actions by learning his/her behavior when interacting with the smart environment. We prepare the datasets and train a predictor that is responsible to decide whether a target transducer value should be changed or not. Our solution achieves a significant improvement for all target transducers studied and most combinations of parameters yields better results than the base case.

"A herringbone water-sediment separation structure (hereinafter referred to as herringbone structure) has been shown to be effective in separating coarse inorganic debris; however, less is known regarding the large wood (LW) filtration effect in this structure. This paper presents preliminary research on the wood filtration effect of the herringbone structure based on physical model tests. The results show that the herringbone structure exhibited effective performance in large wood size segregation, with a 100% component filtration rate for LW that diameter (D) larger than ribbed beam opening width (a). The total filtration rate also exceeded 80% when the Fraud number (Fr) is larger than 2.64 and increased with the increase of Fr. After exceeding Fr (max), total filtration rate would be decreased due to overflow. Beside flow condition, structure parameters influence significantly on LW filtration rate. We attempt to explain the filtration process via particle contact trajectory and particle movement trajectory. The inclined angle of ribbed beam (gamma) contributed the most variation to the filtration rate via influencing the coincidence with particle contact trajectory and particle movement trajectory. The high sensitivity coefficient of ribbed beam (theta) under relatively low Fr conditions implies remarkable influences on LW filtration effects by causing clogging problem. The ribbed beam opening width (a) together with LW diameter (D) influenced the size segregation performance.

"Using the Navier-Stokes equation and assuming a viscosity radially modulated for a quasi-Newtonian fluid, we obtain the impedance of a fluid through microchannels and their corresponding electrical analogs. To solve the Navier-Stokes equation will use the Laplace transform, the Bromwich integral, the residue theorem and Bessel functions. This will give a formula for the impedance in terms of Bessel functions and from these equations to be constructed equivalent electrical circuits. These solutions correspond to the case of quasi-Newtonian fluid it is to say a fluid that does not stagnate in the channel wall as is the case if the fluid is Newtonian. The formulas obtained may have applications in the general theory of microfluidics and microscopic systems design for drug delivery.

"Uncertainty monitoring is a core property of metacognition, allowing individuals to adapt their decision-making strategies depending on the state of their knowledge. Although it has been argued that other animals share these metacognitive abilities, only humans seem to possess the ability to explicitly communicate their own uncertainty to others. It remains unknown whether this capacity is present early in development, or whether it emerges later with the ability to verbally report one's own mental states. Here, using a nonverbal memory-monitoring paradigm, we show that 20-month-olds can monitor and report their own uncertainty. Infants had to remember the location of a hidden toy before pointing to indicate where they wanted to recover it. In an experimental group, infants were given the possibility to ask for help through nonverbal communication when they had forgotten the toy location. Compared with a control group in which infants had no other option but to decide by themselves, infants given the opportunity to ask for help used this option strategically to improve their performance. Asking for help was used selectively to avoid making errors and to decline difficult choices. These results demonstrate that infants are able to successfully monitor their own uncertainty and share this information with others to fulfill their goals.

"Cannabis use disorder (CUD) co-occurs with anxiety disorders at high rates. Little is known about the mechanisms linking CUD and anxiety disorders. One theoretically-driven perspective is that individuals with.anxiety disorders may be more apt to use FSBs (i.e., behaviors that may be effective in decreasing anxiety in the short-term, but can maintain and even exacerbate anxiety in the long-term), which can perpetuate cannabis use despite cannabis-related problems. The present study tested whether FSB use explained the relation of anxiety symptom severity with cannabis quantity and related problems among 77 adults with CUD and comorbid anxiety disorders seeking outpatient CUD treatment. Results indicated that FSB frequency was significantly related to anxiety symptom severity and cannabis problem severity, but not cannabis quantity. Anxiety symptom severity was indirectly (via FSB frequency) related to cannabis problem severity, but not to cannabis quantity. These novel findings suggest that more frequent use of FSBs may play an important role in cannabis problem severity among individuals with CUD and anxiety disorders.(C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

"BackgroundPrior work shows that Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) predicts an increased risk of preterm birth, but the causal pathway(s) are uncertain. We evaluate the associations between PTSD and antepartum complications to explore how PTSD's pathophysiology impacts pregnancy. MethodsThis retrospective cohort analysis of all Veterans Health Administration (VA)-covered deliveries from 2000-12 used the data of VA clinical and administration. Mothers with current PTSD were identified using the ICD-9 diagnostic codes (i.e. code present during the antepartum year), as were those with historical PTSD. Medical and administrative data were used to identify the relevant obstetric diagnoses, demographics and health, and military deployment history. We used Poisson regression with robust error variance to derive the adjusted relative risk estimates (RR) for the association of PTSD with five clinically relevant antepartum complications [gestational diabetes (GDM), preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, growth restriction, and abruption]. Secondary outcomes included proxies for obstetric complexity (repeat hospitalisation, prolonged delivery hospitalisation, and caesarean delivery). ResultsOf the 15 986 singleton deliveries, 2977 (19%) were in mothers with PTSD diagnoses (1880 (12%) current PTSD). Mothers with the complication GDM were 4.9% and those with preeclampsia were 4.6% of all births. After adjustment, a current PTSD diagnosis (reference = no PTSD) was associated with an increased risk of GDM (RR 1.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2, 1.7) and preeclampsia (RR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1, 1.6). PTSD also predicted prolonged (>4 day) delivery hospitalisation (RR 1.2, 95% CI 1.01, 1.4), and repeat hospitalisations (RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2, 1.6), but not caesarean delivery. ConclusionsThe observed association of PTSD with GDM and preeclampsia is consistent with our nascent understanding of PTSD as a disruptor of neuroendocrine and cardiovascular health.

"A preclinical testing model for cancer therapeutics that replicates in vivo physiology is needed to accurately describe drug delivery and efficacy prior to clinical trials. To develop an in vitro model of breast cancer that mimics in vivo drug/nutrient delivery as well as physiological size and bio-composition, it is essential to describe the mass transport quantitatively. The objective of the present study was to develop in vitro and computational models to measure mass transport from a perfusion system into a 3D extracellular matrix (ECM). A perfusion-flow bioreactor system was used to control and quantify the mass transport of a macromolecule within an ECM hydrogel with embedded through-channels. The material properties, fluid mechanics, and structure of the construct quantified in the in vitro model were input into, and served as validation of, the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. Results showed that advection and diffusion played a complementary role in mass transport. As the CFD simulation becomes more complex with embedded blood vessels and cancer cells, it will become more recapitulative of in vivo breast cancers. This study is a step toward development of a preclinical testing platform that will be more predictive of patient response to therapeutics than two-dimensional cell culture.

"In order to assess how the last sea level rise affected the Aegean archipelago, we quantified the magnitude and rate of geographic change for the Aegean islands during the last sea-level-rise episode (21 kyr BP-present) with a spatially explicit geophysical model. An island-specific Area-Distance-Change (ADC) typology was constructed, with higher ADC values representing a higher degree of change. The highest fragmentation rates of the Aegean archipelago occurred in tandem with the largest rates of sea-level-rise occurring between 17 kyr and 7 kyr ago. Sea-level rise resulted in an area loss for the Aegean archipelago of approximately 70%. Spatiotemporal differences in sea-level changes across the Aegean Sea and irregular bathymetry produced a variety of island surface-area loss responses, with area losses ranging from 20% to >90% per island. In addition, sea-level rise led to increased island isolation, increasing distances of islands to continents to >200% for some islands. We discuss how rates of area contractions and distance increases may have affected biotas, their evolutionary history and genetics. Five testable hypotheses are proposed to guide future research. We hypothesize that islands with higher ADC-values will exhibit higher degrees of community hyper-saturation, more local extinctions, larger genetic bottlenecks, higher genetic diversity within species pools, more endemics and shared species on continental fragments and higher z-values of the power-law species-area relationship. The developed typology and the quantified geographic response to sea-level rise of continental islands, as in the Aegean Sea, present an ideal research framework to test biogeographic and evolutionary hypotheses assessing the role of rates of area and distance change affecting biota.

"At a singular point of a DAE, the IVP fails to have a unique solution. Hence, numerical integration methods cannot provide reasonable results. Unfortunately, common error control strategies do not always detect these circumstances and arbitrary solutions may be given to the user without warnings of any kind. Automatic (or Algorithmic) Differentiation (AD) opens new possibilities to realize an analysis of DAEs and to monitor assumptions required for the existence and uniqueness of IVPs. We show how the diagnosis of singular points can be performed for structured quasi-linear DAEs up to index 2. Our approach uses the projector based analysis for DAEs employing AD. The resulting method is illustrated by several examples, with particular emphasis on simple electrical circuits containing controlled sources.

"Purpose A 3D printer was used to realise compartmental dosage forms containing multiple active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) formulations. This work demonstrates the microstructural characterisation of 3D printed solid dosage forms using X-ray computed microtomography (X mu CT) and terahertz pulsed imaging (TPI). Methods Printing was performed with either polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) or polylactic acid (PLA). The structures were examined by X mu CT and TPI. Liquid self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system (SNEDDS) formulations containing saquinavir and halofantrine were incorporated into the 3D printed compartmentalised structures and in vitro drug release determined. Results A clear difference in terms of pore structure between PVA and PLA prints was observed by extracting the porosity (5.5% for PVA and 0.2% for PLA prints), pore length and pore volume from the X mu CT data. The print resolution and accuracy was characterised by X mu CT and TPI on the basis of the computer-aided design (CAD) models of the dosage form (compartmentalised PVA structures were 7.5 +/- 0.75% larger than designed; n = 3). Conclusions The 3D printer can reproduce specific structures very accurately, whereas the 3D prints can deviate from the designed model. The microstructural information extracted by X mu CT and TPI will assist to gain a better understanding about the performance of 3D printed dosage forms.

"A well-established approach to developing new imaging agents and treatments for cancer begins with the recognition of receptors that are overexpressed in cancer cells. Ideally, these same receptors would also be absent, or minimally expressed, in healthy tissue. The mu (mu) and delta (delta) opioid receptors (MOR and DOR respectively) match these criteria, with expression in cancer cells that is higher than primary lung epithelial cells. Naltrexone is a drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of alcohol dependence or prevention of relapse from opioid addiction. Since naltrexone binds with high affinity to both MOR and DOR, it was selected as the platform for development of novel ligands capable of delivering a cytotoxic payload to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study outlines the synthesis of two ligands, with peptide or PEG linkers that were synthesized from 6-amino-naltrexone and conjugated with rhodamine dye or Tc-99m for in vitro imaging, binding affinity or in vivo imaging and biodistribution studies. Transfected HEK cells were used as a model system for over-expression of the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) or the delta-opioid receptor (DOR). Naltrexone and naltrindole were used as competition for MOR and DOR respectively during the binding affinity studies. Mice bearing a xenograft of HEI( cells transfected with mu (HEK-mu) or delta (HEK-delta) opioid receptors were the animal model used for PET imaging and in vivo biodistribution studies. Although the binding affinity studies were encouraging, the biodistribution data for the selected conjugates lacked sufficient specificity. These conjugates were abandoned from further development but information about their synthesis may be valuable to other laboratories working in this field. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"The use of nuclear energy to generate electric power is crucial to meet the high energy demand of a modern economy. In newly constructed nuclear power plants (NPPs), the trend among control systems is to replace the obsolete analog hard-wired systems with the contemporary digital and cyber-based systems. Therefore, cyberphysical security as well as dependability are critical issues in safety critical NPPs. In this paper, we present different levels/layers of protection to manage cyber/physical security. We also discuss the interrelationship between cyber and physical attacks. We adopt generalized stochastic Petri nets to quantitatively evaluate the intrusion probability. We then propose a new cyberframework and show that the proposed framework not only prevents cyberattacks but also conforms to cybersecurity regulations. We also propose a physical framework to prevent potential physical attacks. Finally, we discuss dependability through three metrics, i.e., reliability, maintainability, and availability. A case study is presented to demonstrate that the proposed cyberframework is highly dependable through analyzing steady-state probabilities.

"Rain barrels can be technically shared through social practices or mutual agreement between individual households. This study proposes the evaluation system for a rain barrel sharing network (RBSN) considering three performance criteria of reliability, resiliency, and vulnerability, under plausible climate change scenarios. First, this study shows how the system can be improved in terms of the performance criteria using historical daily rainfall data based on the storage-reliability-yield relationship. This study then examined how the benefits from RBSN are affected by climate change after 100 years. Three climate change scenarios (A1B, A2 and B2) and three global circulation models were used for this purpose. The results showed that the reliability and vulnerability are improved due to sharing and their improvements become larger under climate change conditions. In contrast, the resiliency reduces slightly due to sharing and its reduction is attenuated under climate change conditions. In particular, vulnerability will be reduced significantly under climate change. These results suggest that the sharing of various water resources systems can be an effective climate change adaptation strategy that reduces vulnerability and increases the reliability of the system.

"The selection of suitable working fluids for use in Organic Rankine Cycles (ORC) is strongly addicted to the intended application of the ORC system. The design of the ORC, the kind of heat source and the ambient condition has an influence on the performance of the Organic Rankine Cycle and on the selection of the working fluid. It can come to a discrepancy between the best candidate from the thermodynamic point of view and the transformation into a real machine design. If an axial turbine design is considered for expansion and energy conversion within the ORC, the vapor volume flow ratios within the expansion path, the pressure ratio and of course the number of stages have to be considered within the fluid selection process and for the design parameters. Furthermore, environmental aspects have to be taken into account, e.g. the global warming potential (GWP) and the flammability of the selected fluid. This paper shows the results of the design and fluid selection process for an Organic Rankine Cycle for application in a combined operation with a 2MW class industrial gas turbine. The gas turbine contains two radial compressor stages with an integrated intercooler. To further increase the thermal cycle efficiency, a recuperator has been implemented to the gas turbine cycle, which uses the exhaust gas waste heat to preheat the compressed air after the second compressor, before it enters the combustion chamber. The shaft power is generated by a three stage axial turbine, whereby the first stage is a convection cooled stage, due to a turbine inlet temperature of 1100 degrees C. To further increase the electrical efficiency and the power output of the energy conversion cycle, a combined operation with an organic Rankine cycle is intended. Therefore the waste heat from the GT compressor intercooler is used as first heat source and the waste heat of the exhaust gas after the recuperator as second heat source for the Organic Rankine Cycle. It is intended that the ORC fluid acts as heat absorption fluid within the compressor intercooler. Due to these specifications for the ORC, a detailed thermodynamic analysis has been performed to determine the optimal design parameter and the best working fluid for the ORC, in order to obtain a maximum power output of the combined cycle. Due to the twice coupling of the ORC to the GT cycle, the heat exchange between the two cycles is bounded by each other and a detailed analysis of the coupled cycles is necessary. E.g. the ambient temperature has an enormous influence on the transferred heat from the intercooler to the ORC cycle, which itself affects the heat transfer and temperatures of the transferable heat from the second heat source. Thus, a detailed analysis by considering the ambient operation conditions has been performed, in order to provide a most efficient energy conversion system over a wide operation range. The performance analysis has shown that by application of an ORC for a combined operation with the intercooled and recuperated gas turbine, the combined cycle efficiency can be increased, for a wide ambient conditions range, by more than 3 %pts. and the electrical power output by more than 10 %, in comparison to the stand alone intercooled and recuperated gas turbine.

"Seasonal variations in groundwater reveal lesser concentrations of major ions except NO3- during post-monsoon seasons in shallow aquifers as compared to deeper aquifers. The F- concentration from deeper aquifers is high in both seasons and shows a moderate positive relationship with weathering depth and is >5mg/L in compound lava flow. Groundwater is mainly a Ca-HCO3 type in shallow aquifers and mixed type in deeper aquifers. Fluoride shows a positive correlation with pH, Na+, HCO3- in shallow aquifers and an inverse correlation with Ca2+ and HCO3- from deeper aquifers in both seasons. Approximately 45% of the samples are not suitable for drinking from both aquifers but suitable for irrigation purposes. Rock-water interaction, moderate alkalinity, sluggish movement, and higher residence time are the main causes for high F-in deeper aquifers as compared to shallow aquifers. As recommendations, drinking water requirement may be met from shallow aquifers/surface water and fluoride rich groundwater for other purposes. Most effective defluoridation techniques like ion exchange and reverse osmosis may be adopted along with integrated fluorosis mitigation measures and rooftop rainwater harvesting. Supplementary calcium and phosphorous rich food should be provided to children and creating awareness about safe drinking water habits, side effects of high F-, and NO3- rich groundwater, improving oral hygiene conditions are other measures.

"Dependable complex systems often operate under variable and non-stationary conditions, which requires efficient and extensive monitoring and error detection solutions. Among the many, the paper focuses on anomaly detection techniques, which monitor the evolution of some specific indicators through time to identify anomalies, i.e. deviations from the expected operational behavior. The timely identification of anomalies in dependable, fault tolerant systems allows to timely detect errors in the services and react appropriately. In this paper, we investigate the possibility to monitor the evolution of indicators through time using the random walk model on indicators belonging to Operating Systems, specifically in our study the Linux Red Hat EL5. The approach is based on the experimental evaluation of a large set of heterogeneous indicators, which are acquired under different operating conditions, both in terms of workload and faultload, on an air traffic management target system. The statistical analysis is based on a best-fitting approach aiming to minimize the integral distance between the empirical data distribution and some reference distributions. The outcomes of the analysis show that the idea of adopting a random walk model for the development of an anomaly detection monitor for critical systems that operates at Operating System level is promising. Moreover, standard distributions such as Laplace and Cauchy, rather than Normal, should be used for setting up the thresholds of the monitor. Further studies that involve a new application, a different Operating System and a new layer (an Application Server) will allow verifying the generalization of the approach to other fault tolerant systems, monitored layers and set of indicators.

"Objective: Leptin, the product of the ob gene, is a hormone secreted by adipocytes. This study aimed to measure serum concentrations of leptin in normal - weight subjects (body mass index between 18 and 25) and obese subjects (body mass index greater than or equal to 30). It is designed to support an important role for leptin in human metabolism and obesity, Methods: One hundred lean subjects aged (33.16 +/- 12.47) years and 193 obese subjects aged (38.6 +/- 13.5) years, and 73 obese non-insulin dependent diabetes aged (51.9 +/- 9.6) years were included in the study, where as obesity was defined as a body mass index greater than or equal to 30 serum leptin concentrations were measured using a newly developed radioimmunoassay. Results: The mean +/- SD serum leptin concentrations were 25.99 +/- 15.4 ng per milliliter in the obese subjects and 5.84 +/- 5.27 ng per milliliter in the normal weight subjects (P less than or equal to 0.001). Serum leptin concentrations in specimens from lean and obese adults correlated directly with body mass index (body mass index; Kg/m(2)) (r = 0.74, P less than or equal to 0.001). Correlations were significantly improved by separating results by gender (men r = 0.85, women r = 0.72; P less than or equal to 0.001). Conclusions: These findings showed large differences between leptin concentrations in normal and obese subjects; a progressive increase in leptin concentration with increasing body mass index. These results strongly support an important role for leptin in human metabolism and obesity. Leptin may simply reflect the size of adipose. tissue stores.

"Water is a precious resource. Its demand is rising rapidly and has already exceeded the supply capacity of natural sources in many cities. Airports are spread over vast areas which are normally free from birds and pollution and thus offer immense opportunities for rainwater harvesting which could, to a large extent, meet their non-potable water requirements. This article reviews rainwater treatment procedures at various airports which not only provide a valuable resource for their own consumption but also prevent the entry of pollutants directly into the environment. It also discusses the models and approaches to assess the rainwater harvesting potential of airports on parameters of cost and reliability. It explains the stages involved in the rainwater harvesting systems and how some airports have implemented rainwater treatment systems.

"The rate of drainage of a viscous liquid from initially full cylindrical tubes inclined at various angles to the vertical (0 degrees, 30 degrees, 45 degrees and 60 degrees) was studied in glass and polymethylmethacrylate (Perspex (TM)) tubes of various lengths and diameters using three food materials: honey (Newtonian) and two variants of Marmite (TM) spread (both exhibiting complex rheological behaviour, including shear-thinning and thixotropy). The behaviour was marked by an initially steady rate of drainage in which an air slug descended the tube, followed by slower drainage from an annular film remaining on the wall. Eventually the liquid stopped draining as a filament and entered a dripping regime. Drainage was insensitive to the tube material, whereas the stages of drainage were influenced by the geometry and angle of inclination. Quantitative models are presented for the rate and extent of the initial drainage stage, the rate in a second linear stage (where it existed), and the rate of drainage in the third, falling rate stage. The fourth and final stage, characterised by drop formation, was not modelled. The initial rate can be predicted with reasonable accuracy, allowing the time to remove approximately 50% of the material in a short waiting phase to be calculated, e.g. t=8vL/R(2)g for a Newtonian liquid with kinematic viscosity v in a vertical pipe of radius R and length L. The agreement with the other models is less exact but they capture the general trends reasonably. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

"Chimeric mice, constructed by transplanting human hepatocytes, are useful for predicting the human metabolism of drug candidates. In this study, we investigated whether these mice show similar metabolic profile to humans by examining the hydroxylation of S-warfarin reported to be mainly metabolized to S-7-hydroxywarfarin (7-OH-warfarin), catalyzed by CYP2C9, in humans. When S-H-3-warfarin was administered to chimeric mice and control (uPA(+/+)/SCIDwt/wt) mice, the blood concentration-time curve was higher in chimeric than control mice. Plasma protein binding of S-H-3-warfarin of chimeric and control mice amounted to 98.1 and 92.1%, respectively. When S-H-3-warfarin was administered to these mice, radioactivity was mainly recovered in urine (81.7% in chimeric mice and 65.9% in control mice). After S-H-3-warfarin was administered to these mice, the radioactivity was recovered in the bile of chimeric and control mice at 5.1 and 17.9%, respectively. The main urinary metabolite in chimeric mice was 7-OH-warfarin. the main urinary metabolite in control mice was S-4'-hydroxywarfarin. These results show that mass balance, metabolic disposition of S-H-3-warfarin in chimeric mice with humanized liver were similar to reported human data.

"Objective. Behcet's disease (BD) is a systemic inflammatory disorder polarised to the Th1 and Th17 immune systems. Allergic diseases are polarised to the Th2 immune system. The aim of the present study is to investigate the prevalence of allergic diseases in patients who have BD. Methods. The study involved a large-scale interview survey of Japanese patients with BD at 21 institutes of ophthalmology; 353 patients (255 males and 98 females) were recruited for this study. We analysed the history of allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis (AD), allergic rhinitis (AR), bronchial asthma (BA) and drug/food allergies (FA). Results. Oral aphthous ulcers, ocular lesions, skin lesions, genital ulcers, arthritis, neurological lesions, intestinal lesions, deep vein thrombosis and epididymitis were reported in 95.8%, 98.6%, 72.5%, 44.8%, 13.9%, 6.8%, 6.2%, 3.7% and 1.4% of the patients, respectively. It was also reported that 73 patients (20.7%) had histories of allergic diseases: AD (5 cases, 1.4%), AR (36 cases, 10.2%), BA (19 cases, 5.4%) and FA (30 cases, 8.5%). This percentage was significantly lower than in a survey that Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare conducted for healthy population (47.6%) (odds ratio = 0.29, 95% confidence interval = 0.22-0.38, p=4.9 x 10(-22)).

"Recognition of facial affect has been studied extensively in adults with and without traumatic brain injury (TBI), mostly by asking examinees to match basic emotion words to isolated faces. This method may not capture affect labelling in everyday life when faces are in context and choices are open-ended. To examine effects of context and response format, we asked 148 undergraduate students to label emotions shown on faces either in isolation or in natural visual scenes. Responses were categorised as representing basic emotions, social emotions, cognitive state terms, or appraisals. We used students' responses to create a scoring system that was applied prospectively to five men with TBI. In both groups, over 50% of responses were neither basic emotion words nor synonyms, and there was no significant difference in response types between faces alone vs. in scenes. Adults with TBI used labels not seen in students' responses, talked more overall, and often gave multiple labels for one photo. Results suggest benefits of moving beyond forced-choice tests of faces in isolation to fully characterise affect recognition in adults with and without TBI.

In the case of la reported methods were successfully applied, but the resulting azide proved to be rather unstable and appears more suited to in situ generation and conversion to the click triazole. In the case of 2, reported methods for the synthesis of precursor 5 were ineffective in two cases and resulted in either no bromination a-to the carbonyl or the formation of multiple unwanted side-products, some of which were isolated, 6-13.

"We propose an alternative approach to treat problems with axial or spherical symmetry. Its main characteristic consists of using Cartesian coordinates instead of curvilinear coordinates as usual. To this end, we derive general mathematical expressions giving the spatial derivatives of tensors of arbitrary order along the direction normal to an arbitrary meridian plane for systems with axial symmetry, or along two orthogonal directions normal to an arbitrary radius for systems with spherical symmetry. These relations allow the reduction of the initial three-dimensional problem to a domain with a lower dimension (two for axial symmetry, one for spherical symmetry), while keeping Cartesian coordinates within this domain. The method is illustrated for the flow of a Newtonian fluid between two coaxial cylinders (Couette cell), the Weissenberg effect for viscoelastic fluids and the flow of complex fluids like liquid crystals.

"Stone columns have proved to be a useful technique for supporting flexible structures resting on soft soils. However, in the case of very soft soils, stone columns have encountered excessive settlements due to insufficient lateral resistance offered by the soft soil against bulging of the columns upon loading. The bulging may be reduced to a great extent by reinforcing the columns either by encasing them with geosynthetics or by placing horizontal circular discs of geosynthetics within the columns at a regular interval. In the present study, model tests have been carried out on long floating and end-bearing single and groups of columns with and without reinforcement to evaluate the relative improvement in the failure stress of the composite ground due to different types of reinforcement. The exhumed deformed column shapes were used to understand the failure mechanism for different types and configurations of reinforcement. The geogrid was the best geosynthetic type for encasement for end-bearing columns; for floating columns, geotextile and geogrid were equally good for horizontal circular discs and encasement configurations.

"This work presents a novel mixed-signal control scheme for a boost power factor correction (PFC) rectifier. The digital controller modulates the inductor peak current to produce a low-distortion ac line current in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) and continuous conduction mode (CCM), without the need for average current sensing. A lookup table (LUT) optimizes efficiency at low input currents, by allowing operation at 125-500-kHz DCM based on calculated thresholds. At high input currents, the converter operates at 1-MHz CCM for reduced inductor footprint. An analog off-time generator with a digital frequency locked loop facilitates CCM operation, eliminating the need for slope compensation in the current loop and reduces frequency variations. The LUT is programmed with an adaptive output voltage of 250/450 V for low/highmains line voltage (85-265Vrms) to optimize efficiency over a broad range of conditions. The 150-W PFC prototype operates up to 1 MHz with a peak efficiency of 95% and a total harmonic distortion of 5%.

"Recent neuroimaging work has identified a network of regions that work in concert to update impressions of other people, particularly in response to inconsistent behavior. However, the specific functional contributions of these regions to the updating process remain unclear. Using fMRI, we tested whether increases in activity triggered by inconsistent behavior reflect changes in the stored representations of other people in response to behavioral inconsistency, or merely a response to the inconsistency itself. Participants encountered a series of individuals whose behavior either changed in an attributionally meaningful fashion or was merely inconsistent with the immediately preceding behavior. We observed that left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) and left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) were preferentially recruited in response to unexpected, immoral behavior, whereas a separate set of regions (including dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex and temporoparietal junction/inferior parietal lobule) was preferentially recruited in response to more mundane inconsistencies in behavior. These results shed light on the distributed systems supporting impression updating. Specifically, while many regions supporting updating may primarily respond to moment-to-moment changes in behavior, a subset of regions (e.g. vlPFC and IFG) may contribute to updating person representations in response to trait-relevant changes in behavior.

"This study focuses on four textile industries (DH-GEDA, NOYA, ALMHADI, and ALSAR) established between 2005 and 2008 in the peri-urban areas of Dukem and Gelan. The objectives of the study were to generate baseline information regarding the concentration levels of selected pollutants and to analyze their effects on biophysical environments. This study also attempts to explore the level of exposure that humans and livestock have to polluted effluents and the effects thereof. The findings of this study are based on data empirically collected from two sources: laboratory analysis of sample effluents from the four selected textile plants and quantitative as well as qualitative socioeconomic data collection. As part of the latter, a household survey and focus group discussions (FGDs) with elderly and other focal persons were employed in the towns of Dukem and Gelan. The results of the study show that large concentrations of biological oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS), and pH were found in all the observed textile industries, at levels beyond the permissible discharge limit set by the national Environmental Protection Authority (EPA). Furthermore, sulfide (S-2), R-phosphate (R-PO43), and Zn were found in large concentrations in DH-GEDA and ALMHADI, while high concentrations were also identified in samples taken from ALSAR and ALMHADI. In spite of the clear-cut legal tools, this study shows that the local environment, people, and their livestock are exposed to highly contaminated effluents. We therefore recommend that the respective federal and regional government bodies should reexamine the compliance to and actual implementation of the existing legal procedures and regulations and respond appropriately.

"Pollen analyses of spider web samples, collected from the recently planted Tectona grandis (T. grandis, teak)-dominated tropical deciduous forest of Bhulsidih Village, Korba District (Chhattisgarh, central India), shed light on the relationship between the extant vegetation and pollen rain. The study revealed the dominance of pollen of herbs and trees, whereas shrubs, fern spores and algal remains are meagre. Among the tree taxa, Sapotaceae, Syzygium, Holoptelea, Lannea coromandelica, Shorea robusta and Grewia are dominating with moderate to low and intermittent presence of Madhuca indica, Terminalia, Mitragyna, Schleichera, Anacardiaceae, Diospyros, Emblica officinalis and Flacourtia. However, the rest of the forest constituents are either not represented at all despite their presence in the floristics, which could be attributed to their low pollen productivity owing to entomophily as well as their poor pollen preservation pattern. On the other hand, the ground vegetation is represented by the very high frequency of grasses (Poaceae) along with Tubuliflorae, Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthaceae and Cerealia, however, Artemisia, Xanthium, Malvaceae, Caryophyllaceae and Justicia in moderate to lower values. Ferns, which occur abundantly along the adjoining stream banks, are marked by the sporadic retrieval of trilete spores that could be ascribed to the prevailing damp condition around the sampling provenance. The study, in addition to understanding the pollen-vegetation relationship, could also be helpful in aerobiological study, especially in assessing the allergenicity of various pollen grains/spores in the area of investigation, causing bronchial asthma, hay fever (allergic rhinitis/pollinosis), naso-bronchial allergy and other respiratory disorders along with conjunctivitis, contact dermatitis, eczema, food allergies and other health disorders.

"Choroideraemia is a rare X-linked chorioretinal disease characterised by progressive degeneration of the retina, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choroid. 1 The causes of choroideraemia have been reported to be pathogenic variants in the CHM gene, encoding Rab escort protein 1.(2,3) In affected males, although progressive loss of the visual fields is commonly seen, the central vision is usually maintained until middle age. On the other hand, female carriers generally have good visual acuities but frequently show fundus abnormalities. Moreover, a recent study revealed that female carriers had reduced microperimetric sensitivity.(4) Macular hole (MH) formation is a rare complication in inherited chorioretinal diseases and its occurrence in choroideraemia patients has been reported rarely in the literature. This report presents details on a choroideraemic patient with a full-thickness MH that closed without having to undergo vitrectomy surgery.

"Introduction: Maternal obesity has been shown to be a risk factor for obesity in children and may also affect children's psychosocial outcomes. It is not yet clear whether there are also psycho-emotional mechanisms explaining the effects of maternal weight on young children's weight and psychosocial development. We aimed to evaluate whether maternal body mass index (BMI), mother-child emotional availability (EA), and maternal parenting stress are associated with children's weight and psychosocial development (i.e., internalizing/externalizing symptoms and social competence) and whether these predictors interact with each other. Methods: This longitudinal study included three assessment points (similar to 11 months apart). The baseline sample consisted of N = 194 mothers and their children aged 5-47 months (M = 28.18, SD = 8.44, 99 girls). At t1, we measured maternal weight and height to calculate maternal BMI. We videotaped mother-child interactions, coding them with the EA Scales (fourth edition). We assessed maternal parenting stress with the Parenting Stress Index (PSI) short form. At t1 to t3, we measured height and weight of children and calculated BMI-SDS scores. Children's externalizing and internalizing problems (ti-t3) and social competence (t3, N = 118) were assessed using questionnaires: Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL 1.5-5), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ: prosocial behavior), and a checklist for behavioral problems at preschool age (VBV 3-6: social emotional competence). Results: By applying structural equation modeling (SEM) and a latent regression analysis, we found maternal BMI to predict higher BMI-SDS and a poorer psychosocial development (higher externalizing symptoms, lower social competence) in children. Higher parenting stress predicted higher levels of externalizing and internalizing symptoms and lower social competence. Better maternal EA was associated with higher social competence. We found parenting stress to serve as a mediator in the association between maternal weight and children's psychosocial outcomes. Moreover, children of mothers with an elevated BMI were at greater risk of lower social competence only when their mothers showed low levels of maternal EA (moderation). Conclusion: Interventional studies are needed that investigate the causal pathways between parenting stress, mother-child interaction quality and child outcomes. These aspects might be targets to improve the psychosocial development of the offspring of overweight or obese mothers.

"Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a malignant brain tumor of childhood that carries an extremely poor prognosis. There are similar to 200-300 new cases diagnosed each year, [1, 2] and little progress has been made in changing the prognosis and outcome of the tumor since it was first documented in the literature in 1926 [3]. The median overall survival is 8-11 months [4], with an overall survival rate of 30% at 1 year, and less than 10% at 2 years [4]. This review will provide background information on DIPGs, a historical look at the trends in caring for DIPG, and current trends in diagnosis and treatment. By changing the way we care for these terminal tumors, we can work towards having a better understanding of the underlying molecular biology, and attempt to develop better chemotherapeutic tools to combat the disease.

"Background Treatment with omalizumab has shown a positive effect on food allergies, but no dosages are established. Basophil allergen threshold sensitivity (CD-sens) can be used to objectively measure omalizumab treatment efficacy and correlates with the outcome of double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge to peanut. Objective To evaluate whether individualized omalizumab treatment monitored by CD-sens could be an effective intervention for suppression of allergic reactions to peanut. Methods Severely peanut allergic adolescents (n = 23) were treated with omalizumab for 8 weeks, and CD-sens was analysed before and after. Based on whether CD-sens was suppressed after 8 weeks, the patients either were subject to a peanut challenge or received eight more weeks with increased dose of omalizumab, followed by peanut challenge or another 8-week cycle of omalizumab. IgE and IgE-antibodies to peanut and its components were analysed before treatment. Results After individualized omalizumab treatment (8-24 weeks), all patients continued with an open peanut challenge with no (n = 18) or mild (n = 5) objective allergic symptoms. Patients (n = 15) needing an elevated omalizumab dose (ED) to suppress CD-sens had significantly higher CD-sens values at baseline 1.49 (0.44-20.5) compared to those (n = 8) who managed with normal dose (ND) 0.32 (0.24-5.5) (P < 0.01). Median ratios for Ara h 2 IgE-ab/IgE were significantly higher in the ED group (17%) compared to the ND group (11%). Conclusions and Clinical Relevance Individually dosed omalizumab, monitored by CD-sens, is an effective and safe treatment for severe peanut allergy. The ratio of IgE-ab to storage protein Ara h 2/IgE as well as CD-sens to peanut may predict the need of a higher omalizumab dose.

"2008 is the year of creation of the Bitcoin network consisting of a decentralized database, which is storing all transactions of bitcoin tokens, whose quantity is predetermined by a protocol and independent of any authority. The aim of this article is to describe the limits in the use of Bitcoin as medium of exchange. Bitcoin network operation is carried out at high costs of electrical energy consumption, which, will over time be reflected in the price of transactions. Low transaction prices, which is one of the main arguments of Bitcoin promoters, are only possible with continuous issuance of new bitcoins to circulation. Bitcoin's - prove of work - is the most energetically demanding method from all currently existing methods securing cryptoplatforms. Halving mechanism which reduces the rewards of miners create pressure to decrease hash rate, which is a reflection of the rate of network security. The pressure to decrease hash rate is for now overrun by the increasing efficiency of mining devices. The future will therefore probably bring us fundamental questions: What will it mean for Bitcoin network, if the real costs of running the network will be reflected in costs of transaction? How will Bitcoin network be able to compete with other cryptocurrencies, whose operation is carried out at a much lower cost? Will halving mechanism ultimately cause a declined hash rate, and thereby also a reduction in network security?

"In vitro metabolism of permethrin, a pyrethroid insecticide, was assessed in primary human hepatocytes. In vitro kinetic experiments were performed to estimate the Michaelis-Menten parameters and the clearances or formation rates of the permethrin isomers (cis- and trans-) and three metabolites, cis- and trans-3-(2,2 dichlorovinyl)-2,2-dimethyl-(1-cyclopropane) carboxylic acid (cis- and trans-DCCA) and 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA). Non-specific binding and the activity of the enzymes involved in permethrin's metabolism (cytochromes P450 and carboxylesterases) were quantified. Trans-permethrin was cleared more rapidly than cis-permethrin with a 2.6-factor (25.7 +/- 0.6 and 10.1 +/- 0.3 mu L/min/10(6) cells respectively). A 3-factor was observed between the formation rates of DCCA and 3-PBA obtained from trans- and cis-permethrin. For both isomers, the rate of formation of DCCA was higher than the one of 3-PBA. The metabolism of the isomers in mixture was also quantified. The co-incubation of isomers at different ratios showed the low inhibitory Potential of cis- and trans-permethrin on each other. The estimates of the clearances and the formation rates in the co-incubation condition did not differ from the estimates obtained with a separate incubation. These metabolic parameters may be integrated in physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models to predict the fate of permethrin and metabolites in the human body. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"The performance of a reluctance synchronous machine (RSM) strongly depends on the well-designed geometry of the stator and rotor. Within the intention of a high torque and a high power factor both, the difference and the ratio of the direct- and quadrature inductance must be set to a maximum. In this paper an easy (semi-)analytic design method is used to determine these inductances for a reluctance machine with a standard induction machine stator and a multiple flux-barrier rotor. By varying the rotor and stator dimensions, such as the bore diameter and slot geometry, the effect on the difference and the ratio of the inductances and therefore on the output performance parameters is studied. For the analysis a simplified analytical model, such as a magnetic circuit model of the reluctance synchronous machine is created and solved iteratively. The RSM leakage inductances are determined by using the same analytical equations as used for induction motors. An optimum design for various objective functions like maximum torque, maximum torque per kVA and maximum torque per volume is found, by the means of the analytic model. As a result important conclusions are achieved, regarding the stator and rotor design, respectively.

The oversample and multi-time calculation control strategy was proposed to reduce the typical delay in digital control and improve the system calculation accuracy, lower the inverter output voltage THD. In order to further improve the inverter output voltage waveform, the logic external execution was also proposed. The proposed control method was verified on a 20kVA inverter controlled by microchip processor IC30F5015 DSP. The experiment results indicated that the THD of the inverter output voltage is decreased considerably.

"Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have established themselves as one of the preferred digital implementation platforms in a plethora of current industrial applications, and extensions and improvements are still continuously being included in the devices. This paper reviews recent advancements in FPGA technology, emphasizing the novel features that may significantly contribute to the development of more efficient digital systems for industrial applications. Special attention is paid to the design paradigm shift caused by the availability of increasingly powerful embedded (and soft) processors, which transformed FPGAs from hardware accelerators to very powerful system-on-chip (SoC) platforms. New analog resources, floating-point operators, and hard memory controllers are also described, because of the great advantages they provide to designers. Software tools are being strongly influenced by the design paradigm shift, which requires fromthem a much better support for software developers. Focusing mainly on this issue, recent advancements in software resources [intellectual property (IP) cores and design tools] are also reviewed. The impact of new FPGA features in industrial applications is analyzed in detail in three main areas, namely digital real-time simulation, advanced control techniques, and electronic instrumentation, with focus on mechatronics, robotics, and power systems design. The way digital systems are being currently designed in these areas is comprehensively reviewed, and a critical analysis of how they could significantly benefit from new FPGA features is presented.

"The optimal use of biomass from a global warming mitigation perspective depends upon numerous factors, including competition for land and other constraints. The goal of this study is identifying optimal uses of domestic biomass resources for the case of Denmark, with the objectives of minimizing global warming contribution and fossil energy resource consumption. For this purpose, consequential life cycle assessment of the different options for biomass was performed. Optimal solutions were identified, given specific national environmental targets, using linear programming. Results highlighted that utilizing the energy potential of manure and straw represents the primary opportunity for further global warming mitigation. For this purpose, co-digestion (for manure) and combustion with heat-and-power production (for straw) appear as the most promising technologies. The utilization of biomass (or biogas) for electricity/heat is generally preferred, as long as coal/oil is still used within the energy system. Yet, to fulfill environmental targets for renewable energy in the transport sector, the diversion of a significant share of biogas (and/or other biofuels) from these more beneficial uses is necessary. To completely phase out coal/oil, additional biomass (to current domestic resources) must be included, either through domestic energy crops cultivation or biomass/biofuel import; alternatively, natural gas could be used.

"This paper presents the first multi vector energy analysis for the interconnected energy systems of Great Britain (GB) and Ireland. Both systems share a common high penetratioh of wind power, but significantly different security of supply outlooks. Ireland is heavily dependent on gas imports from GB, giving significance to the interconnected aspect of the methodology in addition to the gas and power interactions analysed. A fully realistic unit commitment and economic dispatch Model coupled to an energy flow model of the gas supply network is developed. Extreme weather events driving increased domestic gas demand and low wind power output were utilised to increase gas supply network stress. Decreased wind profiles had a larger impact on system security than high domestic gas demand. However, the GB energy system was resilient during high demand periods but gas network stress limited the ramping capability of localised generating units. Additionally, gas system entry node congestion in the Irish system was shown to deliver a 40% increase in short run costs for generators. Gds storage was shown to reduce the impact of high demand driven congestion delivering a reduction in total generation costs of 14% in the period studied and reducing electricity imports from GB, significantly contributing to security of supply.

"One of major ideas to design a multivariate public key cryptosystem (MPKC) is to generate its quadratic forms by a polynomial map over an extension field. In fact, Matsumoto-Imai's scheme (1988), HFE (Patarin, 1996), MFE (Wang et al., 2006) and multi-HFE (Chen et al., 2008) are constructed in this way and Sflash (Akkar et al., 2003), Quartz (Patarin et al., 2001), Gui (Petzoldt et al, 2015) are variants of these schemes. An advantage of such extension field type MPKCs is to reduce the numbers of variables and equations to be solved in the decryption process. In the present paper, we study the security of MPKCs whose quadratic forms are derived from a quadratic map over an extension field and propose a new attack on such MPKCs. Our attack recovers partial information of the secret affine maps in polynomial time when the field is of odd characteristic. Once such partial information is recovered, the attacker can find the plain-text for a given cipher-text by solving a system of quadratic equations over the extension field whose numbers of variables and equations are same to those of the system of quadratic equations used in the decryption process.

For this study, the project manager and qualified storm water pollution prevention practitioner (QSP) agreed to extensive interviews about the decisions made and associated costs. Through laws and regulations, constructors are required to take precautionary measures to ensure pollutants stay on jobsites as opposed to running into the storm water system. Moreover, from a practical standpoint, such research might be particularly useful for addressing the challenges constructors are having with the more stringent sustainability regulations. This study used a retrospective case study as part of an exploratory qualitative research strategy for examining the costs associated with storm water pollution prevention on a twenty acre, $48,000,000 wastewater project that had a construction schedule of two years. Cost analysis was taken from historical data and was applied in a quantity takeoff This study was aimed at documenting some practical features of the actual implementation, management, and cost in this particular case. Results indicate the primary roles of the QSP for this project and the SWPPP cost for this project was 0.46% of the total project cost. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"This paper presents a new approach to infer worldwide malware-infected machines by solely analyzing their generated probing activities. In contrary to other adopted methods, the proposed approach does not rely on symptoms of infection to detect compromised machines. This allows the inference of malware infection at very early stages of contamination. The approach aims at detecting whether the machines are infected or not as well as pinpointing the exact malware type/family. The latter insights allow network security operators of diverse organizations, Internet service providers and backbone networks to promptly detect their clients' compromised machines in addition to effectively providing them with tailored anti-malware/patch solutions. To achieve the intended goals, the proposed approach exploits the darknet Internet space and initially filters out misconfiguration traffic targeting such space using a probabilistic model. Subsequently, the approach employs statistical methods to infer large-scale probing activities as perceived by the dark space. Consequently, such activities are correlated with malware samples by leveraging fuzzy hashing and entropy based techniques. The proposed approach is empirically evaluated using a recent 60 GB of real darknet traffic and 65 thousand real malware samples. The results concur that the rationale of exploiting probing activities for worldwide early malware infection detection is indeed very promising. Further, the results, which were validated using publically available data resources, demonstrate that the extracted inferences exhibit noteworthy accuracy and can generate significant cyber security insights that could be used for effective mitigation.

"In mammals, centromere definition involves the histone variant CENP-A (centromere protein A), deposited by its chaperone, HJURP (Holliday junction recognition protein). Alterations in this process impair chromosome segregation and genome stability, which are also compromised by p53 inactivation in cancer. Here we found that CENP-A and HJURP are transcriptionally up-regulated in p53-null human tumors. Using an established mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) model combining p53 inactivation with E1A or HRas-V12 oncogene expression, we reproduced a similar up-regulation of HJURP and CENP-A. We delineate functional CDE/CHR motifs within the Hjurp and Cenpa promoters and demonstrate their roles in p53-mediated repression. To assess the importance of HJURP up-regulation in transformed murine and human cells, we used a CRISPR/Cas9 approach. Remarkably, depletion of HJURP leads to distinct outcomes depending on their p53 status. Functional p53 elicits a cell cycle arrest response, whereas, in p53-null transformed cells, the absence of arrest enables the loss of HJURP to induce severe aneuploidy and, ultimately, apoptotic cell death. We thus tested the impact of HJURP depletion in pre-established allograft tumors in mice and revealed a major block of tumor progression in vivo. We discuss a model in which an epigenetic addiction to the HJURP chaperone represents an Achilles' heel in p53-deficient transformed cells.

"The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a widely used psychopathology screening tool that measures children's emotional symptoms, peer problems, conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention, and prosocial behavior. Previous psychometric studies of the SDQ focused primarily on older children in Western cultures and suffered from several methodological limitations. This study examined the reliability, factor structure, convergent, and discriminant validity of the SDQ by focusing on young Asian American children and using more rigorous methods. The five-factor structure of the SDQ was confirmed by confirmatory factor analysis. The coefficients indicated adequate reliability for all subscales except parent-rated peer problems and conduct problems. The correlated trait-correlated method minus one multitrait-multimethod model provided evidence for convergent validity and discriminant validity of all subscales except for conduct problems relative to hyperactivity/inattention. This study provided new evidence for the psychometric properties of the SDQ in young children and cultural suitability of the SDQ for Asian Americans.

"Background: Fasciolosis remains a significant food-borne trematode disease causing high morbidity around the world and affecting grazing animals and humans. A deeper understanding concerning the molecular mechanisms by which Fasciola hepatica infection occurs, as well as the molecular basis involved in acquiring protection is extremely important when designing and selecting new vaccine candidates. The present study provides a first report of microarray-based technology for describing changes in the splenic gene expression profile for mice immunised with a highly effective, protection-inducing, multi-epitope, subunit-based, chemically-synthesised vaccine candidate against F. hepatica. Methods: The mice were immunised with synthetic peptides containing B-and T-cell epitopes, which are derived from F. hepatica cathepsin B and amoebapore proteins, as novel vaccine candidates against F. hepatica formulated in an adjuvant adaptation vaccination system; they were experimentally challenged with F. hepatica metacercariae. Spleen RNA from mice immunised with the highest protection-inducing synthetic peptides was isolated, amplified and labelled using Affymetrix standardised protocols. Data was then background corrected, normalised and the expression signal was calculated. The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tool was then used for analysing differentially expressed gene identifiers for annotating bio-functions and constructing and visualising molecular interaction networks. Results: Mice immunised with a combination of three peptides containing T-cell epitopes induced high protection against experimental challenge according to survival rates and hepatic damage scores. It also induced differential expression of 820 genes, 168 genes being up-regulated and 652 genes being down-regulated, p value <0.05, fold change ranging from -2.944 to 7.632. A functional study of these genes revealed changes in the pathways related to nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species production, Interleukin-12 signalling and production in macrophages and Interleukin-8 signalling with up-regulation of S100 calcium-binding protein A8, Matrix metallopeptidase 9 and CXC chemokine receptor 2 genes. Conclusion: The data obtained in the present study provided us with a more comprehensive overview concerning the possible molecular pathways implied in inducing protection against F. hepatica in a murine model, which could be useful for evaluating future vaccine candidates.

"The primary focus of the current research is goal projection or the ascription of a perceiver's own goal onto an interaction partner (i.e., target). Extending the finding that perceivers project their goal onto a target (Kawada, Oettingen, Gollwitzer, & Bargh, 2004), two studies applied a cognitive conceptualization of goal pursuit and detection to explain boundary conditions for goal projection in conversation. Experiment 1 demonstrated that the strength of the cognitive association between perceivers' goal and the social context moderated projection: Projection was greater for strongly than moderately or weakly linked goals. Experiment 2 established that the target's goal pursuit efficiency and the congruency between the perceiver's and the target's goals influenced projection: Compared with targets' efficient pursuit of nonidentical goals, projection was greater (a) when the target and perceiver had the same goal regardless of efficiency or (b) when they had different goals but the target was inefficient.

"Object detection and classification have countless applications in human-robot interacting systems. It is a necessary skill for autonomous robots that perform tasks in household scenarios. Despite the great advances in deep learning and computer vision, social robots performing non-trivial tasks usually spend most of their time finding and modeling objects. Working in real scenarios means dealing with constant environment changes and relatively low-quality sensor data due to the distance at which objects are often found. Ambient intelligence systems equipped with different sensors can also benefit from the ability to find objects, enabling them to inform humans about their location. For these applications to succeed, systems need to detect the objects that may potentially contain other objects, working with relatively low-resolution sensor data. A passive learning architecture for sensors has been designed in order to take advantage of multimodal information, obtained using an RGB-D camera and trained semantic language models. The main contribution of the architecture lies in the improvement of the performance of the sensor under conditions of low resolution and high light variations using a combination of image labeling and word semantics. The tests performed on each of the stages of the architecture compare this solution with current research labeling techniques for the application of an autonomous social robot working in an apartment. The results obtained demonstrate that the proposed sensor architecture outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

"Localization, tracking, and recognition of objects and humans are basic tasks that are of high value in the applications of ambient intelligence. Sensing floors were introduced to address these tasks in a non-intrusive way. To recognize the humans moving on the floor, they are usually first localized, and then a set of gait features are extracted (stride length, cadence, and pressure profile over a footstep). However, recognition generally fails when several people stand or walk together, preventing successful tracking. This paper presents a detection, tracking, and recognition technique which uses objects' weight. It continues working even when tracking individual persons becomes impossible. Inspired by computer vision, this technique processes the floor pressure-image by segmenting the blobs containing objects, tracking them, and recognizing their contents through a mix of inference and combinatorial search. The result lists the probabilities of assignments of known objects to observed blobs. The concept was successfully evaluated in daily life activity scenarii, involving multi-object tracking and recognition on low-resolution sensors, crossing of user trajectories, and weight ambiguity. This technique can be used to provide a probabilistic input for multi-modal object tracking and recognition systems.

"Rainwater harvesting could increase the resilience of ecosystems on the Loess Plateau and thus ensure the sustainability of livelihoods that depend on them. As such, it is a key component of strategies for adapting to global climate change. In this study, we used a new method to quantify the rainwater harvesting potential (RWHP) across the whole Loess Plateau and to characterize its spatial and temporal variation over the last four decades on the basis of the variable infiltration capacity model. It was found that that the mean RWHP of the study region was 731.10x10(8)m(3), and the average water layer thickness was 114.34mm. There is considerable scope for rainwater harvesting across the Loess Plateau as a whole, to the extent that it could potentially provide enough water to implement the Grain for Green' Project. The annual average RWHP decreased slightly from 1971 to 2010, and Hurst exponent analysis indicated that this trend will exhibit long-term persistence. The annual RWHP was highest in the southeast of the Loess Plateau and lowest in the northwest. Areas with high RWHP values tended to be clustered around the middle reach of the Yellow River. For most areas, there was no significant change between 1971 and 2010. Those areas for which there was a significant decrease in RWHP were primarily located around the upper-middle reaches of the Weihe River, the upper reach of Jinghe River, the eastern Guanzhong Plain, the Qinhe River watershed and the area around Dongsheng. Quantitative assessments of RWHP are likely to be useful for guiding the development and use of innovative rainwater harvesting technologies around the world and could help to relieve the problems caused by water shortages on the Loess Plateau while simultaneously eliminate the major cause of soil erosion.

"Indoor visible mold growths are known to be associated with allergies and respiratory illnesses. However, a question remains of their compositions and diversities. Using swab sampling and high-throughput DNA sequencing, this study analyzed taxonomic compositions and diversities of fungi on indoor surfaces laden with visible mold growths in residential apartments in South Korea. The sequencing results showed low species diversities with Shannon indices ranging from 0.14 to 2.29 (mean = 1.11). Several allergy-related genera were detected on the same surface, where the most abundant Cladosporium with a mean relative abundance of 41% co-occurred with less abundant Aspergillus (0.094%), Rhodotorula (6.3%), Cryptococcus (3.7%), Alternaria (4.1%), and Crivellia (17%). b diversity analyses showed significant differences in the fungal communities between enclosed balconies and other indoor areas (P < 0.05, ANOSIM), emphasizing a need to sample at multiple indoor locations when assessments are made for indoor visible mold growths. High-throughput sequencing is powerful in characterizing compositions and diversities of fungal communities. Future studies should examine the relationships between taxonomic compositions and diversities of indoor visible molds and health outcomes of allergies and respiratory illnesses in residential buildings.

"In order to gain mechanistic insights into multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis, we utilized a multi-dimensional approach to test the hypothesis that mutations in myelin proteins lead to immune activation and central nervous system autoimmunity in MS. Mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of human MS brain lesions revealed seven unique mutations of PLP1; a key myelin protein that is known to be destroyed in MS. Surprisingly, in-depth genomic analysis of two MS patients at the genomic DNA and mRNA confirmed mutated PLP1 in RNA, but not in the genomic DNA. Quantification of wild type and mutant PLP RNA levels by qPCR further validated the presence of mutant PLP RNA in the MS patients. To seek evidence linking mutations in abundant myelin proteins and immune-mediated destruction of myelin, specific immune response against mutant PLP1 in MS patients was examined. Thus, we have designed paired, wild type and mutant peptide microarrays, and examined antibody response to multiple mutated PLP1 in sera from MS patients. Consistent with the idea of different patients exhibiting unique mutation profiles, we found that 13 out of 20 MS patients showed antibody responses against specific but not against all the mutant-PLP1 peptides. Interestingly, we found mutant PLP-directed antibody response against specific mutant peptides in the sera of pre-MS controls. The results from integrative proteomic, genomic, and immune analyses reveal a possible mechanism of mutation-driven pathogenesis in human MS. The study also highlights the need for integrative genomic and proteomic analyses for uncovering pathogenic mechanisms of human diseases.

"Introduction: Gingival overgrowth, a known side effect of calcium channel blockers, particularly nifedipine, usually presents as a diffuse overgrowth. An unusual presentation of amlodipine-induced gingival overgrowth is presented here, with a large, erythematous gingival mass as the most prominent feature, and rapid, almost complete resolution of the mass after reduction of amlodipine dosage. Case Presentation: A boy, aged 7 years, presented with a gingival mass first noticed a week previously, with no associated discomfort or bleeding. His medical history was significant for Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, bone marrow transplant 5 years previously, and subsequent development of severe chronic graft-versus-host-disease. Hismedication included: 1) amlodipine; 2) enalapril; 3) tacrolimus; 4) sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim; 5) voriconazole; 6) hydrocortisone cream; and 7) intravenous immunoglobulin infusions. Allergies included: 1) vancomycin; 2) metoclopramide; 3) clonidine; and 4) latex. Examination revealed mild generalized gingival overgrowth and the presence of a large, erythematous, sessile, soft, non-tender mass on the mandibular right gingiva between the primary lateral incisor and canine, resembling a pyogenic granuloma. No suppuration, bleeding on probing, or radiographic abnormalities were noted. A recommendation was made to the physician of the patient to replace amlodipine with a different class of antihypertensive. In response, amlodipine dosage was decreased by 50% to 2.5 mg daily. At a 2-week follow-up visit, considerable reduction in size of the gingival mass had occurred, and shortly after complete resolution was reported by his parents. No other intervention, such as scaling or excision, had been performed. Conclusion: Discontinuation or reduction of the amlodipine dose to < 5 mg daily prior to any surgical intervention should be considered in patients taking amlodipine presenting with a gingival mass.

"Background: Radiographic sacroiliitis is the hallmark of ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and detection of acute sacroiliitis is pivotal for early diagnosis of AS. Although radiographic sacroiliitis is a distinguishing feature of AS, sacroiliitis can be seen in a variety of other disease entities. Case presentation: We present an interesting case of sacroiliitis in a patient with Paget disease; the patient presented with inflammatory back pain which was treated with bisphosphonate. This case demonstrates comorbidity with Paget disease and possible ankylosing spondylitis. We also present a review of the literature for other cases of Paget involvement of the sacroiliac joint. Conclusions: In addition, we review radiographic changes to the sacroiliac joint in classical ankylosing spondylitis as well as other common diseases. We compare and contrast features of other diseases that mimic sacroiliitis on a pelvic radiograph including Paget disease, osteitis condensans ilii, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, infections and sarcoid sacroiliitis. There are some features in the pelvic radiographic findings which help distinguish among mimics, however, one must also rely heavily on extra-pelvic radiographic lesions. In addition to the clinical presentation, various nuances may incline a clinician to the correct diagnosis; rheumatologists should be familiar with the imaging differences among these diseases and classic spondylitis findings.

"Autism spectrum disorder diagnoses sometimes change due to misdiagnosis, maturation, or treatment. This study uses a probability-based national surveythe Survey of Pathways to Diagnosis and Servicesto compare currently diagnosed (n=1420) and previously diagnosed (n=187) children aged 6-17years based on retrospective parental reports of early concerns about their children's development, responses to those concerns by doctors and other healthcare providers, the type of provider who made the first autism spectrum disorder diagnosis, and the autism spectrum disorder subtype diagnoses received (if any). Propensity score matching was used to control for differences between the groups on children's current level of functioning and other current characteristics that may have been related to diagnosis loss. Approximately 13% of the children ever diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder were estimated to have lost the diagnosis, and parents of 74% of them believed it was changed due to new information. Previously diagnosed children were less likely to have parents with early concerns about verbal skills, nonverbal communication, learning, and unusual gestures or movements. They were also less likely to have been referred to and diagnosed by a specialist. Previously diagnosed children were less likely to have ever received a diagnosis of Asperger's disorder or autistic disorder.

"A microscope vision system to retrieve small metallic surface via micro laser line scanning and genetic algorithms is presented. In this technique, a 36 pm laser line is projected on the metallic surface through a laser diode head, which is placed to a small distance away from the target. The micro laser line is captured by a CCD camera, which is attached to the microscope. The surface topography is computed by triangulation by means of the line position and microscope vision parameters. The calibration of the microscope vision system is carried out by an adaptive genetic algorithm based on the line position. In this algorithm, an objective function is constructed from the microscope geometry to determine the microscope vision parameters. Also, the genetic algorithm provides the search space to calculate the microscope vision parameters with high accuracy in fast form. This procedure avoids errors produced by the missing of references and physical measurements, which are employed by the traditional microscope vision systems. The contribution of the proposed system is corroborated by an evaluation via accuracy and speed of the traditional microscope vision systems, which retrieve micro-scale surface topography.

"We created a novel laminar-flow based microbial fuel cell (MFC) array to be an integrable and scalable power sourcefor portable lab-on-a-chip (LOC) devices. The microfluidic MFC enabled the laminar flow of anolyte and catholyte streams in a microchannel without any physical membranes while the device harvested electricity by utilizing ion transfers through the laminar interface which acts as a virtual membrane. The array prototype incorporated four series-connected fuel cells and was operated with two common inlets for the continuous introduction of the anolyte and catholyte. In the anodic flow region, microorganisms oxidized organic media and completed respiration by transferring the electrons to the anodes. The protons generated by the anodic reactions passed through the liquid-liquid interfaces and traveled to the cathodic streams. The electrons then moved across the external resistors to the cathodes where they combined with the protons and reduced oxidant (i.e. catholyte). The array generated a maximum power output of 60.5,W/cm(2) using a 100 kg(2) load, which outperformed a single laminar flow MFC unit by a factor of approximately 4. The series or parallel application of this array structure, using microfluidic MFCs integrated into a single LOC device, can offer the potential for on-chip power generation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"Water pollution permit systems are challenging to design and implement. Operational systems that has maintained functionality remains few and far between, particularly in developing countries. We present current progress towards developing such a system for nutrient enrichment based water pollution, mainly from commercial agriculture. We applied a production function approach to first estimate the monetary value of the impact of the pollution, which is then used as reference point for establishing a reserve price for pollution permits. The subsequent market making process is explained according to five steps including permit design, terms, conditions and transactional protocol, the monitoring system, piloting and implementation. The monetary value of the impact of pollution was estimated at R1887 per hectare per year, which not only provide a management budget for filamentous green algae mitigation strategies in the study area, but also enabled the calculation of a reserve price for filamentous green algae pollution permits, which was estimated between R2.25 and R111 per gram filamentous algae and R8.99 per gram at the preferred state.

"The need for a novel automated mosquito perception and classification method is becoming increasingly essential in recent years, with steeply increasing number of mosquito-borne diseases and associated casualties. There exist remote sensing and GIS-based methods for mapping potential mosquito inhabitants and locations that are prone to mosquito-borne diseases, but these methods generally do not account for species-wise identification of mosquitoes in closed-perimeter regions. Traditional methods for mosquito classification involve highly manual processes requiring tedious sample collection and supervised laboratory analysis. In this research work, we present the design and experimental validation of an automated vision-based mosquito classification module that can deploy in closed-perimeter mosquito inhabitants. The module is capable of identifying mosquitoes from other bugs such as bees and flies by extracting the morphological features, followed by support vector machine-based classification. In addition, this paper presents the results of three variants of support vector machine classifier in the context of mosquito classification problem. This vision-based approach to the mosquito classification problem presents an efficient alternative to the conventional methods for mosquito surveillance, mapping and sample image collection. Experimental results involving classification between mosquitoes and a predefined set of other bugs using multiple classification strategies demonstrate the efficacy and validity of the proposed approach with a maximum recall of 98%.

"Today's globalized environment exposes people to culture mixing-mixing of iconic symbols of different cultures in the same space at the same time. Findings on individuals' exposure to culture mixing provide evidence for both exclusionary and inclusionary responses. In this article, we focus on the growing phenomenon of culture mixing of global and local symbols and artifacts. We generate a conceptual model to identify who is likely to respond in what way to the mixed cultural environment and why. To answer these questions, we build on the global acculturation model, which aims to explain individuals' adaptation to the global environment by considering the relative strength of their local and global identities. We extend this model by considering not only the two entities' relative strength but also their balance-the degree of symmetry between the identities' strength. We propose that individuals with dominant (unbalanced) identity types (global or local) will exhibit negative and exclusionary responses to culture mixing, whereas individuals with balanced identity types (glocal or marginal) will exhibit positive and inclusionary responses to culture mixing. We also incorporate the concept of bicultural identity integration (BII) to suggest that individuals with high identification with both cultures (glocals) and with high BII will exhibit more inclusive responses than glocals with low BII. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

"This paper addresses the self-interference (SI) cancellation in a full-duplex radio transceiver. In particular, we focus on shared-antenna based full-duplex transceivers where the self-interference coupling channel is always frequency-selective and can also be strongly time-varying depending on the antenna matching characteristics and reflections from the surroundings. A novel digitally-controlled RF self-interference canceller structure is described, being able to process the signals in a frequency-selective manner as well as track adaptively the time-varying SI features, stemming from the fast digital control loop. A complete demonstrator board is developed, reported and measured, incorporating both the RF processing and the digital control processing. Comprehensive RF measurements are then also carried out and reported at 2.4GHz ISM band, evidencing more than 40dBs of active RF cancellation gain up to 80MHz instantaneous waveform bandwidths. Furthermore, real-time self-adaptive tracking features are successfully demonstrated.

"Connection of wireless sensor and actuator networks (WSANs) to the Internet will enable information flow to these once isolated networks. Distributed Ambient Intelligence (AmI) applications, such as remote monitoring and control services, would become possible if Internet connectivity of WSANs is achieved. However, realization of such applications remains challenging with three major obstacles. First, the homogeneity of embedded sensor and actuator nodes and hence homogeneous networks prevents seamless information flow and service provision. Second, current WSAN technology has limited support for Internet connectivity. Protocol conversion with heavy overhead is required on a more powerful gateway device. Third, there are no common interoperable interfaces between different WSAN standards which has become a barrier to heterogeneous WSAN applications. This paper introduces a design for an integrated IP compatible, heterogeneous WSAN composed of the University of Auckland's AWSAM and Oracle's SunSPOT nodes. This was achieved through the creation of a Hybrid Router, which physically bridges AWSAM and SunSPOT communication with customized network abstraction, and an Edge Router, which provides Internet connectivity.

"In this paper, a unified averaged modeling method is proposed to investigate the fast-scale period-doubling bifurcation of a full-bridge integrated buck-boost inverter with peak current control. In order to increase the resolution of the conventional classic averaged model to half the switching frequency, sample-and-hold effect of inductor current is absorbed into the averaged model, i.e. the proposed unified averaged model can capture the high-frequency dynamical characteristics of the buck-boost inverter, which is both an extension and a modification of conventional averaged model. Based on the unified mode, fast-scale bifurcation is identified, and the corresponding bifurcation point is predicted with the help of the locus movement of all the poles, and their underlying mechanisms are revealed. Detailed analysis shows that the occurrence of high-frequency oscillation means fast-scale bifurcation, while the occurrence of low-frequency oscillation leads to slow-scale bifurcation. Finally, it is demonstrated that the unified averaged model can provide not only a general method to investigate both the slow-and fast-scale bifurcations in a unified framework but also a quite straightforward design-oriented method which can be directly applicable.

"The purpose of this retrospective study is to report the clinical and radiological outcome of total hip arthroplasty in patients with previous hip arthrodesis. We retrospectively reviewed 28 (40 hips) prospectively followed patients in whom ankylosed hips were converted to total hip arthroplasty (THA) between 2010 and 2014 in our institution. The average age at the time of the conversion operation was 40.8 +/- 9.8 years (range 24-62). The ankylosis had lasted 20.4 +/- 13.0 years (range 3-56) before conversion surgery. The etiology of the ankylosis was septic arthritis in 10 (25%), post-traumatic hip osteoarthritis in 8 (20%), developmental hip dysplasia in 6 (15%), rheumatoid arthritis in 6 (15%), primary osteoarthritis in 5 (12.5%) and ankylosing spondylitis in 5 (12.5%) hips. The indications for arthroplasty were intractable low back pain in 14 (50%), hip pain in 24 (85.7%), and ipsilateral knee pain in 19 (67.8%) patients. Harris Hip Score (HHS) was used to rate the clinical results before and after the surgery. Radiographic evaluations included component malposition and loosening. All complications during the study period were recorded. The mean follow-up period was 39.9 +/- 10.6 months (range 24-60). The mean preoperative HHS was 33.3 +/- 8.6 (range 18-50) and the mean HHS at the final follow-up was 74.9 +/- 8.6 (range 52-97). There was a statistically significant increase in HHS (p = 0.0001). HHS was excellent in 1, good in 6, fair in 14 and poor in 7 patients. Increase in HHS was lower than 20 points in one patient (18 points), and one patient required two-staged exchange procedure due to deep infection. Thus, according to our success criteria (increase in HHS more than 20 points, radiographically stable implant, and no further surgical reconstruction), 92.8% (26/28) of patients had benefit from the surgery. Trendelenburg sign was positive in 12 hips. There was limb length inequality in 11 patients (mean 0.5 cm, range 1-3 cm). No patients had heterotopic ossification, sciatic nerve palsy or dislocation. There were five intra-operative fractures of the greater trochanter that were treated with cable wiring. One patient had trochanteric avulsion injury and was treated with trochanteric grip and cables. One patient (2.5%) had deep infection one year after the conversion THA and was treated with two-staged exchange procedure. Conversion hip arthroplasty is an effective treatment method which provides functional recovery and patient satisfaction. However, a proper surgical technique and planning is necessary to minimize the complications.

"Health risk concerns associated with household use of rooftop-harvested rainwater (HRW) constitute one of the main impediments to exploit the benefits of rainwater harvesting in the United States. However, the benchmark based on the U.S. EPA acceptable annual infection risk level of <= 1 case per 10,000 persons per year (<= 10(-4) pppy) developed to aid drinking water regulations may be unnecessarily stringent for sustainable water practice. In this study, we challenge the current risk benchmark by quantifying the potential microbial risk associated with consumption of HRW-irrigated home produce and comparing it against the current risk benchmark. Microbial pathogen data for HRW and exposure rates reported in literature are applied to assess the potential microbial risk posed to household consumers of their homegrown produce. A Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) model based on worst-case scenario (e.g. overhead irrigation, no pathogen inactivation) is applied to three crops that are most popular among home gardeners (lettuce, cucumbers, and tomatoes) and commonly consumed raw. The infection risks of household consumers attributed to consumption of these home produce vary with the type of produce. The lettuce presents the highest risk, which is followed by tomato and cucumber, respectively. Results show that the 95th percentile values of infection risk per intake event of home produce are one to three orders of magnitude (10(-7) to 10(-3)) lower than U.S. EPA risk benchmark (<= 10(-4) pppy). However, annual infection risks under the same scenario (multiple intake events in a year) are very likely to exceed the risk benchmark by one order of magnitude in some cases. Estimated 95th percentile values of the annual risk are in the 10(-4) to 10(-3) pppy range, which are still lower than the 10(-3) to 10(-1) pppy risk range of reclaimed water irrigated produce estimated in comparable studies. We further discuss the desirability of HRW for irrigating home produce based on the relative risk of HRW to reclaimed wastewater for irrigation of food crops. The appropriateness of the <= 10(-4) pppy risk benchmark for assessing safety level of HRW-irrigated fresh produce is questioned by considering the assumptions made for the QMRA model. Consequently, the need of an updated approach to assess appropriateness of sustainable water practice for making guidelines and policies is proposed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"Advances in clinical immunology in the past year included the report of practice parameters for the diagnosis and management of primary immunodeficiencies to guide the clinician in the approach to these relatively uncommon disorders. We have learned of new gene defects causing immunodeficiency and of new phenotypes expanding the spectrum of conditions caused by genetic mutations such as a specific regulator of telomere elongation (RTEL1) mutation causing isolated natural killer cell deficiency and mutations in ras-associated RAB (RAB27) resulting in immunodeficiency without albinism. Advances in diagnosis included the increasing use of whole-exome sequencing to identify gene defects and the measurement of serum free light chains to identify secondary hypogammaglobulinemias. For several primary immunodeficiencies, improved outcomes have been reported after definitive therapy with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and gene therapy.

"This paper presents a method for combining domain knowledge and machine learning (CDKML) for classifier generation and online adaptation. The method exploits advantages in domain knowledge and machine learning as complementary information sources. Whereas machine learning may discover patterns in interest domains that are too subtle for humans to detect, domain knowledge may contain information on a domain not present in the available domain dataset. CDKML has three steps. First, prior domain knowledge is enriched with relevant patterns obtained by machine learning to create an initial classifier. Second, genetic algorithms refine the classifier. Third, the classifier is adapted online on the basis of user feedback using the Markov decision process. CDKML was applied in fall detection. Tests showed that the classifiers developed by CDKML have better performance than machine-learning classifiers generated on a training dataset that does not adequately represent all real-life cases of the learned concept. The accuracy of the initial classifier was 10 percentage points higher than the best machine-learning classifier and the refinement added 3 percentage points. The online adaptation improved the accuracy of the refined classifier by an additional 15 percentage points.

"Pyrethroid chemicals are attractive alternatives to the organophosphates (OPs) because of their selective toxicity against pests rather than mammals. The carboxylesterases (CEs) are hepatic enzymes that metabolize ester-containing xenobiotics such as pyrethroids. The primary aim of this study was to gain insight into the catalytic properties of the CE enzymes in humans that metabolize pyrethroids, while a secondary aim was to investigate pyrethroid metabolism using CEs from other mammalian species. Pure human CEs (hCE-1 and hCE-2), a rabbit CE (rCE), and two rat CEs (Hydrolases A and B) were used to study the hydrolytic metabolism of the following pyrethroids: 1R trans-resmethrin (bioresmethrin), 1RS trans-permethrin, and 1RS cis-permethrin. hCE-1 and hCE-2 hydrolyzed trans-permethrin 8- and 28-fold more efficiently than cis-permethrin (when k(cat)/K-m values were compared), respectively. In contrast, hydrolysis of bioresmethrin was catalyzed efficiently by hCE-1, but not by hCE-2. The kinetic parameters for the pure rat and rabbit CEs were qualitatively similar to the human CEs when hydrolysis rates of the investigated pyrethroids were evaluated. Further, a comparison of pyrethroid hydrolysis by hepatic microsomes from rats, mice, and humans indicated that the rates for each compound were similar between species, which further supports the use of rodent models for pyrethroid metabolism studies. An eight-fold range in hydrolytic rates for 11 individual human liver samples toward transpermethrin was also found, although this variability was not related to the levels of hCE-1 protein in each sample. We also determined that the CE inhibitor 2-chloro-3,4-dimethoxybenzil blocked hCE-2-catalyzed trans-permethrin hydrolysis 36 times more potently than hCE-1. Thus, this inhibitor will be useful in future studies that examine CE-mediated metabolism of pyrethroids. While there are likely other esterases in human liver that hydrolyze pyrethroids, the results of this study clearly demonstrate that hCE-1 and hCE2 are human pyrethroid-hydrolyzing CEs.

"Objective: Recent studies have suggested that autoimmune diseases and immune activation play a part in the pathogenesis of different neurodevelopmental disorders. This study investigated the association between a personal history and a family history of autoimmune disease and the risk of developing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Method: A cohort was formed of all singletons born in Denmark from 1990 to 2007, resulting in a study population of 983,680 individuals followed from 1995 to 2012. Information on autoimmune diseases was obtained from the Danish National Hospital Register. Individuals with ADHD were identified through the Danish National Hospital Register and the Danish Psychiatric Central Register. Results: In total, 23,645 children were diagnosed with ADHD during the study period. Autoimmune disease in the individual was associated with an increased risk of ADHD by an incidence rate ratio of 1.24 (95% CI 1.10-1.40). The primary analyses associated maternal autoimmune disease with ADHD in the offspring (incidence rate ratio 1.12, 95% CI 1.06-1.19), whereas a paternal history of autoimmune diseases was not significantly associated with ADHD in the offspring. In exploratory analyses, an increased risk of ADHD was observed for children with a family history of thyrotoxicosis, type 1 diabetes, autoimmune hepatitis, psoriasis, and ankylosing spondylitis. Conclusion: A personal history and a maternal history of autoimmune disease were associated with an increased risk of ADHD. The previously reported association between type 1 diabetes and ADHD was confirmed. In addition, specific parental autoimmune diseases were associated with ADHD in offspring.

"Proanthocyanidins have been suggested as an effective antibiotic alternative, however their mechanisms are still unknown. The present study investigated the effects of grape seed proanthocyanidins on gut microbiota and mucosal barrier using a weaned piglet model in comparison with colistin. Piglets weaned at 28 day were randomly assigned to four groups treated with a control ration, or supplemented with 250 mg/kg proanthocyanidins, kitasamycin/colistin, or 250 mg/kg proanthocyanidins and half-dose antibiotics, respectively. On day 28, the gut chyme and tissue samples were collected to test intestinal microbiota and barrier function, respectively. Proanthocyanidins treated piglets had better growth performance and reduced diarrhea incidence (P < 0.05), accompanied with decreased intestinal permeability and improved mucosal morphology. Gene sequencing analysis of 16S rRNA revealed that dietary proanthocyanidins improved the microbial diversity in ileal and colonic digesta, and the most abundant OTUs belong to Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes spp.. Proanthocyanidins treatment decreased the abundance of Lactobacillaceae, and increased the abundance of Clostridiaceae in both ileal and colonic lumen, which suggests that proanthocyanidins treatment changed the bacterial composition and distribution. Administration of proanthocyanidins increased the concentration of propionic acid and butyric acid in the ileum and colon, which may activate the expression of GPR41. In addition, dietary proanthocyanidins improved the antioxidant indices in serum and intestinal mucosa, accompanied with increasing expression of barrier occludin. Our findings indicated that proanthocyanidins with half-dose colistin was equivalent to the antibiotic treatment and assisted weaned animals in resisting intestinal oxidative stress by increasing diversity and improving balance of gut microbes.

"A passive rainwater harvesting technique was used to design a sustainable landscape for a residential lot located in the desert. The design was adapted to the Desert Southwest region of the United States based on thirty years of daily historical climate data including precipitation and reference evapotranspiration (ET0). Four cities including El Paso, TX, Albuquerque, NM, Phoenix, AZ, and Pahrump, NV, were selected to represent the area. The residential lot was broken up into micro-watersheds reflecting the runoff of water from each separate portion of the house roof, driveway, and lawn area. The paper explains in detail the design steps for one of the micro-watersheds where water retention and infiltration structures were distributed throughout the soil area to capture stormwater runoff close to its source. A passive rainwater capture landscape was obtained by using the stormwater captured in the infiltration structures and stored in the surrounding soil. Native vegetation (shrubs and trees) will use this water exclusively for growth. These plants will not require watering once their root establishment period has passed, except in extreme droughts. Meanwhile, stormwater discharge from the lot will decrease and the groundwater recharge will increase. Results indicate that the current urban water budget can be made sustainable by replacing watering of landscape by municipal water with harvested stormwater. This results in a relatively lush and shady environment even in desert climates. The success is an artifact of the tendency of urban watersheds to increase the volume of stormwater relative to pre-development conditions.

Moreover, a compound database of triterpene saponins was established and successfully applied to uncover their distribution features in ESL samples collected from different areas.

"Background: A steadily increasing pattern of breast cancer mortality has been reported in South Korea since the late 1980s. This paper explored the trends of educational inequalities of female breast cancer mortality between 1983 and 2012 in Korea, and conducted age-period-cohort (APC) analysis by educational level. Methods: Age-standardized mortality rates of breast cancer per 100,000 person-years were calculated. Relative index of inequality (RII) for breast cancer mortality was used as an inequality measure. APC analyses were conducted using the Web tool for APC analysis provided by the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics at the U.S. National Cancer Institute. Results: An increasing trend in breast cancer mortality among Korean women between 1983 and 2012 was due to the increased mortality of the lower education groups (i.e., no formal education or primary education and secondary education groups), not the highest education group. The breast cancer mortality was higher in women with a tertiary education than in women with no education or a primary education during 1983-1992, and the reverse was true in 1993-2012. Consequently, RII was changed from positive to negative associations in the early 2000s. The lower education groups had the increased breast cancer mortality and significant cohort and period effects between 1983 and 2012, whereas the highest group did not. Conclusions: APC analysis by socioeconomic position used in this study could provide an important clue for the causes on breast cancer mortality. The long-term monitoring of socioeconomic patterning in breast cancer risk factors is urgently needed.

"The objective of the paper is to evaluate the potential of tank-based rainwater harvesting systems in free standing houses as the source control method to mitigate peak roof runoff due to rainfall in urban areas. To this aim, the water balance simulation of the rainwater tank was carried out using both high resolution rainfall series and toilet water demand data extracted from the database of results built in a previous field campaign involving six experimental households in southern Italy. Simulations show that significant potential for runoff peak reduction exists, basically depending on the rainwater tank size and on the characteristics of the water demand in the house.

"Coral reefs maintain extraordinary biodiversity and provide protection from tsunamis and storm surge, but inshore coral reef health is degrading in many regions due to deteriorating water quality. Deconvolving natural and anthropogenic changes to water quality is hampered by the lack of long term, dated water quality data but such records are required for forward modelling of reef health to aid their management. Reef corals provide an excellent archive of high resolution geochemical (trace element) proxies that can span hundreds of years and potentially provide records used through the Holocene. Hence, geochemical proxies in corals hold great promise for understanding changes in ancient water quality that can inform broader oceanographic and climatic changes in a given region. This article reviews and highlights the use of coral-based trace metal archives, including metal transported from rivers to the ocean, incorporation of trace metals into coral skeletons and the current 'state of the art' in utilizing coral trace meatl proxies as tools for monitoring various types of local and regional source-specific pollution ( river discharge, land use changes, dredging and dumping, mining, oil spills, antifouling paints, atmospheric sources, sewage). The three most commonly used coral trace element proxies (i.e., Ba/Ca, Mn/Ca, and Y/Ca) are closely associated with river runoff in the Great Barrier Reef, but considerable uncertainty remains regarding their complex biogeochemical cycling and controlling mechanisms. However, coral-based water quality reconstructions have suffered from a lack of understanding of so-called vital effects and early marine diagenesis. The main challenge is to identify and eliminate the influence of extraneous local factors in order to allow accurate water quality reconstructions and to develop alternate proxies to monitor water pollution. Rare earth elements have great potential as they are self-referencing and reflect basic terrestrial input. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"Changes in global climate drivers have multiple impacts on lake ecosystems, as rain and wind conditions control catchment surface runoff and lake mixing regimes. However, human activities in lakes and their watersheds may have direct and indirect impacts on aquatic optical properties. Therefore, identifying key drivers that can be controlled (human) from those that cannot (climate) represents an important objective. In the present study, we develop an algorithm to estimate the concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in Lake Hongze (the fourth largest freshwater lake in China) using MODIS/Aqua images with concurrent data collected from six cruise surveys. The algorithm resulted in root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 7.64-7.86 mg/L for SPM ranging from 10 to 80 mg/L. The algorithm was applied to 1602 cloud-free MODIS/Aqua images from 2002 to 2015. Our results show: (1) inter-annual and seasonal variations of SPM concentrations in lake Hongze are divided into two distinct periods between 2002 and 2011 and 2012-2015, with the transition associated to intensive dredging activities that were initiated in 2012. (2) SPM concentrations exhibit four typical patterns of spatial distribution which depend on local meteorological (wind speed and wind direction) and hydrological conditions (catchment rainfall and Huai River flowrate). Based on these results, a new spatial zoning of the lake is derived to support government and agency monitoring. The study shows additive and synergistic effects of climate change and human activities on SPM concentrations over short and long timescales and the possibility to monitor these changes by remote sensing in shallow optically complex lakes.

"Allergies are steadily gaining in importance in the Western world. For over one hundred years, immunology has been the only causal treatment. Specific immunotherapy (SIT) aims at the cure of allergy or at least freedom from allergy symptoms. In association with this, adherence poses a complex problem. Both treatment applications commonly used in Germany-sublingual and subcutaneous immunotherapy-show poor persistence on the part of the patients. In most cases, SIT is not carried out to the end of the recommended duration and instead is discontinued prematurely. Corresponding figures from 3aEuroyear studies in the literature range from 41- 93% for uncompleted SLIT and from 40-77% for uncompleted SCIT. Patient adherence is subject to influencing factors of various dimensions that are interdependent in complex relationships. The physician-patient relationship is just as decisive a factor for treatment success as the patient's understanding of allergy, treatment, and the importance of adherence.

"If there is a 'platonic world' of mathematical facts, what does contain precisely? I observe that if is too large, it is uninteresting, because the value is in the selection, not in the totality; if it is smaller and interesting, it is not independent of us. Both alternatives challenge mathematical platonism. I suggest that the universality of our mathematics may be a prejudice and illustrate contingent aspects of classical geometry, arithmetic and linear algebra, making the case that what we call mathematics is always contingent.

"In this two-part paper, we propose a general algorithmic framework for the minimization of a nonconvex smooth function subject to nonconvex smooth constraints, and also consider extensions to some structured, nonsmooth problems. The algorithm solves a sequence of (separable) strongly convex problems and maintains feasibility at each iteration. Convergence to a stationary solution of the original nonconvex optimization is established. Our framework is very general and flexible and unifies several existing successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithms. More importantly, and differently from current SCA approaches, it naturally leads to distributed and parallelizable implementations for a large class of nonconvex problems. This Part I is devoted to the description of the framework in its generality. In Part II, we customize our general methods to several (multiagent) optimization problems in communications, networking, and machine learning; the result is a new class of centralized and distributed algorithms that compare favorably to existing ad-hoc (centralized) schemes.

"Rationale Environmental challenges during adolescence, such as drug exposure, can cause enduring behavioral and molecular changes that contribute to life-long maladaptive behaviors, including addiction. Selectively bred highresponder (bHR) and low-responder (bLR) rats represent a unique model for assessing the long-termimpact of adolescent environmental manipulations, as they inherently differ on a number of addiction-related traits. bHR rats are consideredBaddiction-prone, whereas bLR rats are Baddictionresilient, at least under baseline conditions. Moreover, relative to bLRs, bHR rats are more likely to attribute incentive motivational value to reward cues, or to Bsign-track. Objectives We utilized bHR and bLR rats to determine whether adolescent cocaine exposure can alter their inborn behavioral and neurobiological profiles, with a specific focus on Pavlovian conditioned approach behavior (i.e., sign-vs. goal-tracking) and hippocampal neurogenesis. Methods bHR and bLR rats were administered cocaine (15 mg/kg) or saline for 7 days during adolescence (postnatal day, PND 33-39) and subsequently tested for Pavlovian conditioned approach behavior in adulthood (PND 62-75), wherein an illuminated lever (conditioned stimulus) was followed by the response-independent delivery of a food pellet (unconditioned stimulus). Behaviors directed toward the lever and the food cup were recorded as sign-and goal-tracking, respectively. Hippocampal cell genesis was evaluated on PND 77 by immunohistochemistry. Results Adolescent cocaine exposure impaired hippocampal cell genesis (proliferation and survival) and enhanced the inherent propensity to goal-track in adult bLR, but not bHR, rats. Conclusions Adolescent cocaine exposure elicits long-lasting changes in stimulus-reward learning and enduring deficits in hippocampal neurogenesis selectively in adult bLR rats. Conclusions Adolescent cocaine exposure elicits long-lasting changes in stimulus-reward learning and enduring deficits in hippocampal neurogenesis selectively in adult bLR rats.

"The American flag is a powerful symbol that campaigns seek to harness for electoral gain. But the flag's benefits may be more elusive than they appear. We begin by presenting content analysis of the flag's prevalence in 2012 U.S. presidential campaign ads, which suggests both candidates saw flags as advantageous. Then, in two experiments set during the 2012 campaign and a later study with prospective 2016 candidates, we find flag exposure provides modest but consistent benefits for Republican candidates among voters high in symbolic patriotism, racial prejudice, and Republican identification. These effects arise regardless of which candidate appears with the flag. Taken together, our results speak to both the power and limitations of the American flag in electioneering. Beyond practical implications for campaigns, these studies emphasize the heterogeneity of citizens' reactions to visual political symbols and highlight potent links between symbolic attitudes and a nation's flag.

"As one of the most reliable technologies, network intrusion detection system (NIDS) allows the monitoring of incoming and outgoing traffic to identify unauthorised usage and mishandling of attackers in computer network systems. To this extent, this paper investigates the experimental performance of Snort-based NIDS (S-NIDS) in a practical network with the latest technology in various network scenarios including high data speed and/or heavy traffic and/or large packet size. An effective testbed is designed based on Snort using different muti-core processors, e.g., i5 and i7, with different operating systems, e.g., Windows 7, Windows Server and Linux. Furthermore, considering an enterprise network consisting of multiple virtual local area networks (VLANs), a centralised parallel S-NIDS (CPS-NIDS) is proposed with the support of a centralised database server to deal with high data speed and heavy traffic. Experimental evaluation is carried out for each network configuration to evaluate the performance of the S-NIDS in different network scenarios as well as validating the effectiveness of the proposed CPS-NIDS. In particular, by analysing packet analysis efficiency, an improved performance of up to 10% is shown to be achieved with Linux over other operating systems, while up to 8% of improved performance can be achieved with i7 over i5 processors.

"A challenge to protein based therapies is the ability to produce biologically active proteins and their ensured delivery. Various approaches have been utilised including fusion of protein transduction domains with a protein or biomolecule of interest. A compounding issue is lack of specificity, efficiency and indeed whether the protein fusions are actually translocated into the cell and not merely an artefact of the fixation process. Here we present a novel platform, allowing the inducible export and uptake of a protein of interest. The system utilises a combination of the Tetracyline repressor system, combined with a fusion protein containing the N-terminal signal peptide from human chorionic gonadotropin beta-subunit, and a C-terminal poly-arginine domain for efficient uptake by target cells. This novel platform was validated using enhanced green fluorescent protein as the gene of interest. Doxycycline efficiently induced expression of the fusion protein. The human chorionic gonadotropin beta-subunit facilitated the export of the fusion protein into the cell culture media. Finally, the fusion protein was able to efficiently enter into neighbouring cells (target cells), mediated by the poly-arginine cell penetrating peptide. Importantly we have addressed the issue of whether the observed uptake is an artefact of the fixation process or indeed genuine translocation. In addition this platform provides a number of potential applications in diverse areas such as stem cell biology, immune therapy and cancer targeting therapies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

"On product design the use of composite materials has been steadily growing on aircraft industry, driven primarily by weight lost on structural components, which leads to better efficiency on fuel consumption, closely linked to economic issues and sustainability. On manufacturing planning the use of lean concepts has helped aircraft manufacturers to better manage its production resources leading also to more efficient and sustainable ways to fabricate and assemble aircraft structures. This paper describes how Embraer is combining these two philosophies for the development of the vertical and horizontal stabilizers of its latest product, the Legacy 500, and the planning and construction of its new composites assembly line in Evora. It first analysis how automated composites fabrication methods like ATL help to reduce parts thus reducing weight and assembly hours. It also analysis solutions developed to guarantee design for assembly and design for automation concepts. Going from product design to manufacturing planning the line presents a layout of monorail, which allows to assembly both stabilizers on the determined rates and is flexible enough to be used for new products and to absorb rate changes. Highly flexible automation with robots is used to panel drilling and fastening. A zero-gravity system is applied to lift heavy components from monorails to working benches. All these applications result on high quality products and very efficient production methods which ultimately generate a more sustainable way to manufacture aircraft components.

"BackgroundThe liver is the major site for alcohol metabolism in the body and therefore the primary target organ for ethanol (EtOH)-induced toxicity. In this study, we investigated the invitro response of human liver cells to different EtOH concentrations in a perfused bioartificial liver device that mimics the complex architecture of the natural organ. MethodsPrimary human liver cells were cultured in the bioartificial liver device and treated for 24hours with medium containing 150mM (low), 300mM (medium), or 600mM (high) EtOH, while a control culture was kept untreated. Gene expression patterns for each EtOH concentration were monitored using Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Gene chips. Scaled expression profiles of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were clustered using Fuzzy c-means algorithm. In addition, functional classification methods, KEGG pathway mapping and also a machine learning approach (Random Forest) were utilized. ResultsA number of 966 (150mM EtOH), 1,334 (300mM EtOH), or 4,132 (600mM EtOH) genes were found to be differentially expressed. Dose-response relationships of the identified clusters of co-expressed genes showed a monotonic, threshold, or nonmonotonic (hormetic) behavior. Functional classification of DEGs revealed that low or medium EtOH concentrations operate adaptation processes, while alterations observed for the high EtOH concentration reflect the response to cellular damage. The genes displaying a hormetic response were functionally characterized by overrepresented cellular ketone metabolism and carboxylic acid metabolism. Altered expression of the genes BAHD1 and H3F3B was identified as sufficient to classify the samples according to the applied EtOH doses. ConclusionsDifferent pathways of metabolic and epigenetic regulation are affected by EtOH exposition and partly undergo hormetic regulation in the bioartificial liver device. Gene expression changes observed at high EtOH concentrations reflect in some aspects the situation of alcoholic hepatitis in humans.

"With the increasing emergence of ambient intelligence, sensors and wireless network technologies, robotic assistance becomes a very active area of research in autonomous intelligent systems. Robotic systems would be integrated in the environment as physical autonomous entities. These entities will be able to interact independently with the ambient environment and provide services such as assistance to people at homes, offices, buildings and public spaces. Furthermore, robots as cognitive entities will be able to coordinate their activities with other physical or logical entities, to move, to feel and explore the surrounding environment, decide and act to meet the situations they may encounter. These cognitive operations will be part of a smart network which can provide individually or collectively, new features and various support services anywhere and anytime. The aim of this research work is to build a multimodal fusion engine using the semantic web. This multimodal system will be applied on a wheelchair with a manipulated arm to help people with disabilities interact with their main tool of movement and their environment. This work focuses on building a multimodal interaction fusion engine to better understand the multimodal inputs using the concept of ontology. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate barriers to pro-social behaviour in the form of blood donating using self-determination theory. Design/methodology/approach - Respondents were recruited through intercepts at a major international university and at points within the community in a capital city in Australia. Sampling was conducted over a three-week period resulting in a sample of 617 respondents. Findings - Results show intrinsic motivations positively influence intentions towards blood donation, self- identity, and locus of control. Further, despite positively influencing other factors, external regulation positively influenced amotivation indicating the more likely people feel pressured to donate blood, the less likely they will be motivated to donate blood. Originality/value - This would suggest one way to influence more people to become donors is to place greater focus on the positive emotional feelings they derive from the act of donating blood and the control they have over that donation. Using external regulation strategy which often suggests people must or have-to donate blood may be limiting blood donation numbers.

"This study is part of a longer-term project to provide embodied conversational agents (ECAs) with behaviors that enable them to build and maintain rapport with their human partners. We focus on paralinguistic behaviors, and especially nonverbal behaviors, and their role in communicating rapport. Using an ECA that guides its players through a speech-controlled game, we attempt to measure the familiarity built between humans and ECAs across several interactions based on paralinguistic behaviors. In particular, we studied the effect of differences in the amplitude of nonverbal behaviors by an ECA interacting with a human across two conversational sessions. Our results suggest that increasing amplitude of nonverbal paralinguistic behaviors may lead to an increased perception of physical connectedness between humans and ECAs.

In contrast to many related works which exclusively employ sensors mounted on mobile robots, this work shows a method to achieve this goal in a smart environment where external sensors are used to sense people's positions. By using probabilistic models and filters, the evolution of the environment's state is predicted and optimal paths with respect to safety and performance are planned. Experiments in reality and in a simulation environment show the applicability in real-world scenarios and the advantages over classical path planning approaches.

"Introduction: We examined the association between decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and subjective cognitive decline (SCD). Methods: We included 161 AD, 95 MCI, and 143 SCD patients from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort. We used 3-T pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling to estimate whole-brain and regional partial volume-corrected CBF. Neuropsychological tests covered global cognition and five cognitive domains. Associations were investigated using linear regression analyses. Results: In the whole sample, reduced overall and regional CBF was associated with impairment in all cognitive domains. We found significant interactions between diagnosis and CBF for language and between diagnosis and parietal CBF for global cognition and executive functioning. Stratification showed that decreased CBF was associated with worse performance in AD patients but not in MCI or SCD. Discussion: Our results suggest that CBF may have potential as a functional marker of disease severity. (C) 2016 the Alzheimer's Association. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

"Background: Expression of host microRNAs (miRNAs) changes markedly during influenza A virus (IAV) infection of natural and adaptive hosts, but their role in genetically determined host susceptibility to IAV infection has not been explored. We, therefore, compared pulmonary miRNA expression during IAV infection in two inbred mouse strains with differential susceptibility to IAV infection. results: miRNA expression profiles were determined in lungs of the more susceptible strain DBA/2J and the less susceptible strain C57BL/6J within 120 h post infection (hpi) with IAV (H1N1)PR8. Even the miRNomes of uninfected lungs differed substantially between the two strains. After a period of relative quiescence, major miRNome reprogramming was detected in both strains by 48 hpi and increased through 120 hpi. Distinct groups of miRNAs regulated by IAV infection could be defined: (1) miRNAs (n = 39) whose expression correlated with hemagglutinin (HA) mRNA expression and represented the general response to IAV infection independent of host genetic background; (2) miRNAs (n = 20) whose expression correlated with HA mRNA expression but differed between the two strains; and (3) remarkably, miR-147-3p, miR-208b-3p, miR-3096a- 5p, miR-3069b-3p, and the miR-467 family, whose abundance even in uninfected lungs differentiated nearly perfectly (area under the ROC curve >0.99) between the two strains throughout the time course, suggesting a particularly strong association with the differential susceptibility of the two mouse strains. Expression of subsets of miRNAs correlated significantly with peripheral blood granulocyte and monocyte numbers, particularly in DBA/2J mice; miR-223-3p, miR-142-3p, and miR-20b-5p correlated most positively with these cell types in both mouse strains. Higher abundance of antiapoptotic (e.g., miR-467 family) and lower abundance of proapoptotic miRNAs (e.g., miR-34 family) and those regulating the PI3K-Akt pathway (e.g., miR-31-5p) were associated with the more susceptible DBA/2J strain. conclusion: Substantial differences in pulmonary miRNA expression between the two differentially susceptible mouse strains were evident even before infection, but evolved further throughout infection and could in part be attributed to differences in peripheral blood leukocyte populations. Thus, pulmonary miRNA expression both before and during IAV infection is in part determined genetically and contributes to susceptibility to IAV infection in this murine host, and likely in humans.

"Background: Neurodegenerative disorders, such as deficits in learning, memory and cognition and Alzheimer's disease are associated with diabetes mellitus. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophic factor and is known to possess anti-obesity, anti-diabetic actions and is believed to have a role in memory and Alzheimer's disease. Objective: To investigate whether STZ can reduce BDNF production by rat insulinoma (RIN5F) cells in vitro and decrease BDNF levels in the pancreas, liver and brain in vivo. Methods: Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced cytotoxicity to RIN5F cells in vitro and type 2 DM in Wistar rats was employed in the present study. Cell viability, activities of various anti-oxidants and secretion of BDNF by RIN5F cells in vitro were measured using MIT assay, biochemical methods and ELISA respectively. In STZ-induced type 2 DM rats: plasma glucose, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels and BDNF protein expression in the pancreas, liver and brain tissues were measured. In addition, neuronal count and morphology in the hippocampus and hypothalamus areas was assessed. Results: STZ-induced suppression of RIN5F cell viability was abrogated by BDNF. STZ suppressed BDNF secretion by RIN5F cells in vitro. STZ-induced type 2 DM rats showed hyperglycemia, enhanced plasma IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels and reduced plasma and pancreas, liver and brain tissues (P < 0.001) and increased oxidative stress compared to untreated control. Hypothalamic and hippocampal neuron in STZ-treated animals showed a decrease in the number of neurons and morphological changes suggesting of STZ cytotoxicity. Conclusions: The results of the present study suggest that STZ is not only cytotoxic to pancreatic beta cells but also to hypothalamic and hippocampal neurons by inducing oxidative stress. STZ ability to suppress BDNF production by pancreas, liver and brain tissues suggests that impaired memory, learning, and cognitive dysfunction seen in diabetes mellitus could be due to BDNF deficiency.

"This paper highlights the digital control problems and issues during the controller design and suggests the solutions to resolve them. For this purpose, digital controller designed on the basis of digital redesign or emulation technique is applied to a buck converter working in continuous conduction mode. Nonlinearities due to the ADC and DAC quantizers, loop-delay, etc. are introduced into the control loop and their adverse effects on performance are interrogated. The nonlinearities are suppressed by retuning the digital controller. The order of the controller may increase and require more resources for its implementation. The quantizers' nonlinearities add quantization noise into the loop and may cause offsets and limit cycle oscillations (LCOs). The overall phase margin gets reduced due to the delay thus keeping the bandwidth limited and leading the system towards instability. The well-tuned loop remains asymptotically stable if the nonlinearities are neglected. MATLAB/Simulink environment is used to address all the issues.

The glycosylation we detected was diverse and comprised 17 different glycoforms. We then used molecular modeling to demonstrate that complex glycopeptides are capable of binding the MHC and may interact with complementarity determining regions.

"In this paper, reliability issues of Stacked Gate (SG)-Gate Electrode Workfunction Engineered (GEWE)-Silicon Nanowire (SiNW) MOSFET is examined over a wide range of ambient temperatures (200-600 K) and results so obtained are simultaneously compared with conventional SiNW and GEWE-SiNW MOSFEI using 3D-technology computer aided design quantum simulation. The results indicate that two temperature compensation points (TCP) are obtained: one for drain current (I-ds) and other for cut-off frequency (f(T)) where device Figure Of Merits (FOMs) become independent of temperature, and it is found at 0.65 V in SG-GEWE-SiNW in comparison to other devices, hence will open opportunities for wide range of temperature applications. Furthermore, significant improvement in Analog/RF performance of SG-GWEW-SiNW is observed in terms of I-on/I-off, Subthreshold Swing (SS), device efficiency, f(T), noise conductance and noise figure as temperature reduces. It is also observed that at low temperature SG-GEWE-SiNW unveils highly stable linearity performance owing to reduced distortions. These results explain the improved reliability of SG-GEWE-SiNW at low temperatures over GEWE-SiNW MOSFET. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"Objective: Superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1, OMIM: 147450) is one of the major antioxidant enzymes, which plays a vital role in clearance of reactive oxygen species. A genetic polymorphism of 50 bp insertion/deletion (Ins/Del) in the promoter region of the SOD1 was reported. The aims of the present study are to evaluate the influence of this polymorphism on the SOD1 mRNA levels in human peripheral blood cells and its association with risk of heroin dependency. Methods: The present study consisted of 47 healthy students of Shiraz University (south-west Iran) for investigating the association between the Ins/Del polymorphism on expression level of SOD1, also a total of 442 heroin dependent and 799 healthy controls were included in a case-control study investigating the association between the study polymorphism and risk of dependency to heroin. The quantitative SOD1 mRNA expression levels were investigated using quantitative real-time PCR. Results: Statistical analysis revealed a significant difference between the study genotypes (t = 5.17; df = 45; P < 0.001). The Del allele of the study polymorphism decreased approximately 33% of the SOD1 mRNA levels of the gene in the heterozygote individuals. Statistical analysis indicating that in both genders, neither the Ins/Del nor the Del/Del genotypes was associated with the risk of heroin addiction. Conclusions: The present study indicating that although the Ins/Del polymorphism of SOD1 is associated with the SOD1 expression levels, this polymorphism is not associated with the risk of dependency to heroin.

"The present study investigates the relative extent to which judgments of people's behavior are influenced by truth (as measured by averaged observer-judgments) and by systematic bias (i.e., perceivers' preexisting views of target persons). Using data from online questionnaires and laboratory sessions (N = 155), we demonstrate that self- and peer-judgments of people's actual behavior in specific situations are somewhat accurate but are also affected by what perceivers thought of the targets before observing their behavior. The latter effect comprises a general evaluative component (generally positive or negative views of targets) and a content-specific component (views of targets in terms of specific characteristics, for example, restrained). We also found that friends, but not targets themselves, tend to judge targets' behaviors more positively than unacquainted observers do. The relevance of these findings for person perception in everyday life and in research contexts is discussed.

"The ER-mitochondria organizing network (ERMIONE) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is involved in maintaining mitochondrial morphology and lipid homeostasis. ERMES and MICOS are two scaffolding complexes of ERMIONE that contribute to these processes. ERMES is ancient but has been lost in several lineages including animals, plants, and SAR (stramenopiles, alveolates and rhizaria). On the other hand, MICOS is ancient and has remained present in all organisms bearing mitochondrial cristae. The ERMIONE precursor evolved in the alpha-proteobacterial ancestor of mitochondria which had the central subunit of MICOS, Mic60. The subsequent evolution of ERMIONE and its interactors in eukaryotes reflects the integrative co-evolution of mitochondria and their hosts and the adaptive paths that some lineages have followed in their specialization to certain environments. By approaching the ERMIONE from a perspective of comparative evolutionary cell biology, we hope to shed light on not only its evolutionary history, but also how ERMIONE components may function in organisms other than S. cerevisiae.

"Many vital interdependent cellular functions including proteostasis, lipogenesis and Ca2+ homeostasis are executed by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Exogenous insults can impair ER performance: this must be rapidly corrected or cell death will ensue. Protective adaptations can boost the functional capacity of the ER and form the basis of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Activated in response to the accumulation of misfolded proteins, the UPR can halt protein translation while increasing proteinhandling chaperones and the degradation of erroneous proteins through a conserved three-tier molecular cascade. However, prolonged activation of the UPR can result in the maladaptation of the system, resulting in the activation of inflammatory and apoptotic effectors. Recently, UPR and its involvement in neurodegenerative disease has attracted much interest and numerous potentially 'drugable' points of crosstalk are now emerging. Here, we summarize the functions of the ER and UPR, and highlight evidence for its potential role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, before discussing several key targets with therapeutic potential.

"Physical attractiveness is suggested to be an indicator of biological quality and therefore should be stable. However, transient factors such as gaze direction and facial expression affect facial attractiveness, suggesting it is not. We compared the relative importance of variation between faces with variation within faces due to facial expressions. 128 participants viewed photographs of 14 men and 16 women displaying the six basic facial expressions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise) and a neutral expression. Each rater saw each model only once with a randomly chosen expression. The effect of expressions on attractiveness was similar in male and female faces, although several expressions were not significantly different from each other. Identity was 2.2 times as important as emotion in attractiveness for both male and female pictures, suggesting that attractiveness is stable.

"Though present in low numbers, dendritic cells (DCs) are recognized as major players in the control of cancer by adaptive immunity. The roles of cytotoxic CD8(+) T-cells and Th1 helper CD4(+) T-cells are well-documented in murine models of cancer and associated with a profound prognostic impact when infiltrating human tumors, but less information is known about how these T-cells gain access to the tumor or how they are primed to become tumor-specific. Here, we highlight recent findings that demonstrate a vital role of CD103(+) DCs, which have been shown to be experts in cross-priming and the induction of anti-tumor immunity. We also focus on two different mediators that impair the function of tumor-associated DCs: prostaglandin E-2 and beta-catenin. Both of these mediators seem to be important for the exclusion of T-cells in the tumor microenvironment and may represent key pathways to target in optimized treatment regimens against cancer.

"Present study is on the interdependent nature of hydraulic parameters and morphometric variables of a bedrock river. In this study, using dumpy level, GPS, satellite images and some mathematical equations a data set on hydraulics and morphometric variables of a bedrock channel, named Bhatajhor, of eastern India was generated. That data set was used to (1) find out impulse-response relations between hydraulic variables (2) find out relations between morphometric variables and (3) find out relations between hydraulic and morphometric variables. Seven equations (5-11) were formulated based on this empirical study to the end. The seven empirical relations, most of which include only two variables, involve channel cross-section dimensions (area, width, mean depth, maximum depth, width/depth ratio, hydraulic radius), slope and hydraulic variables (velocity, kinetic energy, stream power, Manning's n factor, Chezy's C factor and shear stress). Observation shows relatively higher coefficient of determination (R2) between variables like velocity and Manning's n factor (0.67), velocity and Chezy's C factor (0.67), slope and t (0.89), w/d ratio and hydraulic radius (0.53), slope and w/d ratio (0.50).

"The reporting of ecological phenomena and environmental status routinely required point observations, collected with traditional sampling approaches to be extrapolated to larger reporting scales. This process encompasses difficulties that can quickly entrain significant errors. Remote sensing techniques offer insights and exceptional spatial coverage for observing the marine environment. This review provides guidance on (i) the structures and discontinuities inherent within the extrapolative process, (ii) how to extrapolate effectively across multiple spatial scales, and (iii) remote sensing techniques and data sets that can facilitate this process. This evaluation illustrates that remote sensing techniques are a critical component in extrapolation and likely to underpin the production of high-quality assessments of ecological phenomena and the regional reporting of environmental status. Ultimately, is it hoped that this guidance will aid the production of robust and consistent extrapolations that also make full use of the techniques and data sets that expedite this process.

"Oxidative stress has been confirmed as a contribution to the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of many neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Caffeoylquinic acids (CQAs) are considered to have anti-oxidative stress ability in a previous study, but the structure-activity relationships (SARs) of CQAs in neuroprotective effects are still unclear. In the present study, we primarily expound the SARs of CQAs in counteracting H2O2-induced injury in SH-SY5Y cells. We found that CQAs (1-10) represented the protection of SH-SY5Y cells against H2O2-induced injury in varying degrees and malonyl groups could obviously increase the anti-oxidative stress ability of CQAs. Intensive studies of 4,5-O-dicaffeoyl-1-O-(malic acid methyl ester)-quinic acid (MDCQA) indicated that the mechanisms could potentially involve activation of endogenous antioxidant enzymes and the regulation of the phosphorylation of MAPKs and AKT. In conclusion, MDCQA could serve as a neuroprotective agent with a potential to attenuate oxidative stress.

"This paper presents a fully digital-control soft start mechanism with coefficients Ki optimization for DC-DC power converters. During the soft start phase, a ladder reference voltage steps up gradually to make inductor current ramp up smoothly and overshoot voltage is minimized with the proposed coefficients Ki distribution. Simulation results show that massive inductor current can be well avoided during the soft start process with the proposed soft start mechanism, which only occupies a chip area of 300umx120um.

"This paper proposes an optimization model to determine the optimal tank size of a single residential housing unit for rainwater harvesting and storage. Taking into account the site specific data such as the rainfall profile, the roof area of the building, the water consumption per capita and the number of residents, an integrated optimization model based on linear programming is proposed to decide on the size of rainwater storage tank to build such that the net present value of the total tank construction costs and freshwater purchase costs is minimized. The proposed model was tested on a case study from Northern Cyprus, the results of which emphasized the feasibility of rainwater harvesting as a sustainable supplement to the depleting aquifers in the region. The study also offers managerial insights on the impact of various parameters such as the number of residents, roof area, discount rate, water consumption per capita, unit cost of building the rainwater tank, and rainfall characteristics on the optimal tank size and on the net financial benefit gained from rainwater harvesting through detailed sensitivity analysis.

"Wind power is a clean and renewable resource, and it is rapidly becoming an important component of sustainable development and resource transfer. However, the construction of wind farms impacts the environment and has been the subject of considerable research. In this study, we verified whether China's GF-2 HD satellite (GF-2) could be used to monitor the 10 million kilowatt wind power grassland construction area in Jiuquan City, Gansu Province. Monitoring was performed by comparing the imaging results from the Landsat 8 OLI and China's GF-1 HD satellite (GF-1). We performed an interactive interpretation of the remote sensing images and verified the accuracy of these interpretations using measured field data. We evaluated 354 pieces of wind turbine equipment with an average construction density of 0.31 km(2) per device. The construction of a single wind turbine was found to damage nearly 3000 m(2) of grassland. The average area of grassland damaged by 3 MW and 1.5 MW turbines was 5757 m(2) and 2496 m(2), respectively. Approximately 2.44 km(2) of farmland was occupied by wind power construction and accounted for approximately 2.2% of the study area. Roads covered 60.6% of the farmland occupied by wind power construction. The average difference between the measured and calculated GF-2 image data was 0.09, and the overall interpretation accuracy was approximately 84%. Therefore, the use of comprehensive imaging analyses and GF-2 image data are feasible for monitoring grasslands under construction for wind power. In addition, the impacts of wind farm construction on vegetation destruction and soil erosion are discussed. In this study, grassland wind farms are explored using remote sensing tools to guide decision making with regards to the rational use of grassland resources and their sustainable development.

"The current study examines the effect of status information on the neural substrates of person perception. In an event-related fMRI experiment, participants were presented with photographs of faces preceded with information denoting either: low or high financial status (e.g., earns $25,000 or earns $350,000), or low or high moral status (e.g., is a tobacco executive or does cancer research). Participants were asked to form an impression of the targets, but were not instructed to explicitly evaluate their social status. Building on previous brain-imaging investigations, regions of interest analyses were performed for brain regions expected to support either cognitive (i.e., intraparietal sulcus) or emotional (i.e., ventromedial prefrontal cortex) components of social status perception. Activation of the intraparietal sulcus was found to be sensitive to the financial status of individuals while activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex was sensitive to the moral status of individuals. The implications of these results towards uncovering the neural substrates of status perception and, more broadly, the extended network of brain regions involved in person perception are discussed.

"The tropics are predicted to become warmer and drier, and understanding the sensitivity of tree species to drought is important for characterizing the risk to forests of climate change. This study makes use of a long-term drought experiment in the Amazon rainforest to evaluate the role of leaf-level water relations, leaf anatomy and their plasticity in response to drought in six tree genera. The variables (osmotic potential at full turgor, turgor loss point, capacitance, elastic modulus, relative water content and saturated water content) were compared between seasons and between plots (control and through-fall exclusion) enabling a comparison between short- and long-term plasticity in traits. Leaf anatomical traits were correlated with water relation parameters to determine whether water relations differed among tissues. The key findings were: osmotic adjustment occurred in response to the long-term drought treatment; species resistant to drought stress showed less osmotic adjustment than drought-sensitive species; and water relation traits were correlated with tissue properties, especially the thickness of the abaxial epidermis and the spongy mesophyll. These findings demonstrate that cell-level water relation traits can acclimate to long-term water stress, and highlight the limitations of extrapolating the results of short-term studies to temporal scales associated with climate change.

"The permanent magnet synchronous reluctance machine (PMSynRM) is a type of permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) with the objective to provide high reluctance torque. This is realized by a particularly designed constellation of flux barriers in the rotor of the machine. Beside high efficiency and supplied power density, an acoustic evaluation of this machine is performed for various applications, for example in hybrid and electric vehicles (HEV, EV). A study for the acoustic design of a PMSynRM is presented in this paper. An approach to improve the magnetic circuit by varying the shape of the flux barriers is introduced. Using numerical simulations every operating point in the d-q-diagram is considered. The local force density in the air gap of the machine is calculated and analyzed with a 2-D Fourier Transformation. The results are used as analysis criterion.

"Background: In spite of its great promise, metabolomics has proven difficult to execute in an untargeted and generalizable manner. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has made it possible to gather data on thousands of cellular metabolites. However, matching metabolites to their spectral features continues to be a bottleneck, meaning that much of the collected information remains uninterpreted and that new metabolites are seldom discovered in untargeted studies. These challenges require new approaches that consider compounds beyond those available in curated biochemistry databases. Description: Here we present Metabolic In silico Network Expansions (MINEs), an extension of known metabolite databases to include molecules that have not been observed, but are likely to occur based on known metabolites and common biochemical reactions. We utilize an algorithm called the Biochemical Network Integrated Computational Explorer (BNICE) and expert-curated reaction rules based on the Enzyme Commission classification system to propose the novel chemical structures and reactions that comprise MINE databases. Starting from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) COMPOUND database, the MINE contains over 571,000 compounds, of which 93% are not present in the PubChem database. However, these MINE compounds have on average higher structural similarity to natural products than compounds from KEGG or PubChem. MINE databases were able to propose annotations for 98.6% of a set of 667 MassBank spectra, 14% more than KEGG alone and equivalent to PubChem while returning far fewer candidates per spectra than PubChem (46 vs. 1715 median candidates). Application of MINEs to LC-MS accurate mass data enabled the identity of an unknown peak to be confidently predicted. Conclusions: MINE databases are freely accessible for non-commercial use via user-friendly web-tools at http://minedatabase.mcs.anl.gov and developer-friendly APIs. MINEs improve metabolomics peak identification as compared to general chemical databases whose results include irrelevant synthetic compounds. Furthermore, MINEs complement and expand on previous in silico generated compound databases that focus on human metabolism. We are actively developing the database; future versions of this resource will incorporate transformation rules for spontaneous chemical reactions and more advanced filtering and prioritization of candidate structures.

"Light weight engineering and composite technologies are key strategies in modem product development in mechanical engineering as well as in biomedical applications, where innovation is driven by novel material concepts and surface functionalities. Designed or customized surface properties by advanced coating technologies are an important discipline in this context. Ceramic, metallurgical and cermet layers can be manufactured in a most appropriate way by high energetic thermokinetic deposition techniques like plasma spraying, electric arc and last not least by supersonic flame spraying (HVOF). These technologies perform high deposition rates, high flexibility to use various materials and their combinations and applications in micro to macro scale products. The final properties of the coatings and layer composites do not just depend on the properties of the combined materials but, as in the case of ceramic coated light metals, are distinctly affected by the occurring residual stresses and their interaction with operational load stresses. With respect to the complex geometries of most components, their dimensional and positional tolerances a further strong influence of the robot kinematics of the plasma or HVOF torches during coating manufacturing is observed. By combining the expertise in materials and manufacturing engineering coatings and composites with high performance and reliability can be achieved. This is shown in the development of functionally coated cylinder liners and crankcases for ultra light weight engines as well as for ceramic coated bioinert and biodegradable substrates in medical surgery. It will be shown that cast engine block bores can be directly coated by using an automated HVOF process, obtaining improved coating results. The internal coating process by hypersonic flame spraying is a superior technological alternative to the APS process for high quality cylinder liner and engine crankcase applications. The applications of such ceramic and cermet coatings are not limited to automotive and biomedical applications, i. e. for wear and friction properties or biomedical compatibility, but can be used for tailored thermophysical, electrophysical or catalytic properties in various technical systems.

"Sleep disorders are among the most common clinical problems and possess a significant concern for the geriatric population. More importantly, while around 40% of elderly adults have sleep-related complaints, sleep disorders are more frequently associated with co-morbidities including age-related neurodegenerative diseases and mild cognitive impairment. Recently, increasing evidence has indicated that disturbed sleep may not only serve as the consequence of brain atrophy, but also contribute to the pathogenesis of dementia and, therefore, significantly increase dementia risk. Since the current therapeutic interventions lack efficacies to prevent, delay or reverse the pathological progress of dementia, a better understanding of underlying mechanisms by which sleep disorders interact with the pathogenesis of dementia will provide possible targets for the prevention and treatment of dementia. In this review, we briefly describe the physiological roles of sleep in learning/memory, and specifically update the recent research evidence demonstrating the association between sleep disorders and dementia. Plausible mechanisms are further discussed. Moreover, we also evaluate the possibility of sleep therapy as a potential intervention for dementia.

"This paper presents a systematic, socio-technical and empirical evaluation of the actual energy and environmental performance of a sustainably-designed institutional building (Southeast England), intended to be a teaching tool and 'living laboratory' of sustainability. Despite the building being designed to high sustainability standards (Energy Performance Certificate rating of A, low reliance on fossil fuels, natural ventilation and rainwater harvesting) and also being under-utilised during the in-use stage (lower hours of occupation and number of occupants), its actual energy-related carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions are four times more than predicted. This is due to poor energy management of the building, underperformance of the biomass boiler and wasteful energy practices in terms of excessive winter overheating in the atrium, inappropriate lighting controls, and electrical equipment being left on standby. Due to lack of training and understanding of the energy manager, the building management system was not used adequately and issues with installation, commissioning and maintenance of the biomass boiler led to its disuse; however the photovoltaic system generated electricity as expected. Findings from the study show how a mixed-methods approach of building performance evaluation (BPE) should be embedded as part of the build process, to ensure that performance outcomes are met in reality.

"This study aimed at optimizing horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands (CWs) to improve hydraulic performance and pollutant removal efficiency. A groundwater modeling package (MODFLOW) was used to optimize three design parameters (length-to-width ratio, inlet/outlet-to-length ratio, and substrate size configuration). Using the optimized parameters, three pilot-scale CWs were built to treat actual wastewater. For model validation, we used a tracer test to evaluate hydraulic performance, and investigated the pollutant spatial distributions and removal efficiencies. We conclude that MODFLOW is suitable for designing CWs, accurately predicting that increasing hydraulic conductivity from surface to bottom layers could improve performance. However, the effect of vegetation, which decreased the hydraulic conductivity of the surface layer, should be considered to improve simulation results. Multilayer substrate configuration, with increasing hydraulic conductivity from the surface to bottom layers, significantly increased pollutant removal compared with monolayer configuration. The spatial variation in pollutant transport and degradation through the filling substrate showed that the multilayer configuration was able to increase use of the available space and moderately reduced short-circuiting and dead zones. Thus, multilayer CWs had higher experimental retention times, effective volume fractions and hydraulic efficiencies, and lower short-circuiting compared with monolayer CWs operating under similar conditions.

"Objective: The interleukin 17 (IL-17) cytokine family is involved in a number of chronic inflammatory diseases. In spite of contradictory findings and a lack of causality in clinical studies, IL-17 inhibition for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has regained attention as a potential therapeutic pathway, after demonstrating disease-modifying capabilities in ankylosing spondylitis. We investigated the clinical associations of interleukin 17 A (IL-17A) in patients with SLE. Material and Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed involving SLE patients (n= 102; age: 49 years; 86% female) recruited from a regional registry. IL-17A levels were determined by immunoassay, disease activity by Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index-2K (SLEDAI-2K), and cumulative damage by Systemic Lupus International Collaborative Clinics Damage Index (SDI) scores. Non-parametric techniques were used to examine the association between IL-17A and disease activity and autoantibody profiles were compared with healthy controls (n= 31): principal component analysis (PCA) was used to determine the interplay of immune cells across disease states and damage development in SLE patients. Results: SLE patients had higher IgG levels, lower T-cell and B-cell counts, but median IL-17A levels did not differ from the controls (28.4 vs. 28.4 pg/mL, p= 0.9). In SLE patients, IL-17A did not correlate with SLEDAI-2K or SDI, but was inversely related with age (correlation coefficients, Rs.=- 0.29, p< 0.05), systolic blood pressure (Rs.=- 0.31, p< 0.05), years of smoking (Rs.=- 0.43, p< 0.05), cumulative heart (Rs.=- 0.22, p< 0.05), and malignancy damage (Rs.=- 0.18, p< 0.05). Serological correlations for IL-17A existed with immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels (Rs.= 0.21, p< 0.05), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels (Rs.= 0.28, p< 0.05), proteinuria (Rs.= 0.64, p< 0.05), and pre- albumin (Rs.=- 0.22, p< 0.05). Longitudinal data showed only modest fluctuation in IL- 17A levels, independent of SLEDAI- 2K. Conclusion: These results suggest that IL- 17A, while participating in inflammation, may also serve a protective purpose in SLE patients.

"Population growth, urbanisation and climate change represent significant pressures on urban water resources, requiring water managers to consider a wider array of management options that account for economic, social and environmental factors. The Dynamic Urban Water Simulation Model (DUWSiM) developed in this study links urban water balance concepts with the land use dynamics model MOLAND and the climate model LARS-WG, providing a platform for long term planning of urban water supply and water demand by analysing the effects of urbanisation scenarios and climatic changes on the urban water cycle. Based on potential urbanisation scenarios and their effects on a city's water cycle, DUWSiM provides the functionality for assessing the feasibility of centralised and decentralised water supply and water demand management options based on forecasted water demand, stormwater and wastewater generation, whole life cost and energy and potential for water recycling. DUWSiM has been tested using data from Dublin, the capital of Ireland, and it has been shown that the model is able to satisfactorily predict water demand and stormwater runoff.

"Similarity search is an important and fundamental problem, and thus widely used in various fields of computer science including multimedia, computer vision, database, information retrieval, etc. Recently, since loitering behavior often leads to abnormal situations, such as pick pocketing and terrorist attacks, its analysis attracts increasing attention from research communities. In this paper, we present AntiLoiter, a loitering discovery system adopting efficient similarity search on surveillance videos. As we know, most of existing systems for loitering analysis, mainly focus on how to detect or identify loiterers by behavior tracking techniques. However, the difficulties of tracking-based methods are known as that their analysis results are heavily influenced by occlusions, overlaps, and shadows. Moreover, tracking-based methods need to track the human appearance continuously. Therefore, existing methods are not readily applied to real-world surveillance cameras due to the appearance discontinuity of criminal loiterers. To solve this problem, we abandon the tracking method, instead, propose AntiLoiter to efficiently discover loiterers based on their frequent appearance patterns in longtime multiple surveillance videos. In AntiLoiter, we propose a novel data structure Luigi that indexes data using only similarity value returned by a corresponding function (e.g., face matching). Luigi is adopted to perform efficient similarity search to realize loitering discovery. We conducted extensive experiments on both synthetic and real surveillance videos to evaluate the efficiency and efficacy of our approach. The experimental results show that our system can find out loitering candidates correctly and outperforms existing method by 100 times in terms of runtime.

"In fluid mechanics, a lot of authors have been executing their researches to obtain the analytical solutions of NavierStokes equations, even for 3D case of compressible gas flow. But there is an essential deficiency of non-stationary solutions indeed. In our derivation, we explore the case of non-stationary helical flow of the NavierStokes equations for incompressible fluids at any given initial conditions for velocity fields (it means an open choice for the space part of a solution). Such a non-stationary helical flow is proved to be decreasing exponentially in regard to the time-parameter, the extent of time-dependent exponential component is given by the coefficient of kinematic viscosity, multiplied by the square of the coefficient of proportionality between the vorticity and velocity field.

"Smart-metering allows electricity utilities to provide consumers with better information on their energy usage and to apply time-of-use pricing. These measures have been shown to reduce electricity consumption and induce time-shifting of demand. Less is known about how they affect residential energy efficiency investment behaviour. We use data from a randomised-controlled trial on a sample of almost 2500 Irish consumers, conducted over a 12-month period to investigate the effect of smart-metering and residential feedback on household investment behaviour. The results show that exposure to time-of-use pricing and information stimuli, while reducing overall and peak usage, can also have the unintended effect of reducing investment in energy efficiency measures within the home. Our findings indicate that households exposed to treatment were less likely to adopt any energy saving measure (23-28 % on average), and those households adopted less energy saving features than those in the control group (15-21 % on average). This result highlights the potential for behavioural interventions to have unintended consequences on behaviours other than those specifically targeted. Furthermore, it underlines the importance of examining a wider range of outcomes and allowing longer time-scales when evaluating this type of experiment.

"Hyperspectral anomaly detection (AD) is an important problem in remote sensing field. It can make full use of the spectral differences to discover certain potential interesting regions without any target priors. Traditional Mahalanobis-distance-based anomaly detectors assume the background spectrum distribution conforms to a Gaussian distribution. However, this and other similar distributions may not be satisfied for the real hyperspectral images. Moreover, the background statistics are susceptible to contamination of anomaly targets which will lead to a high false-positive rate. To address these intrinsic problems, this paper proposes a novel AD method based on the graph theory. We first construct a vertex- and edge-weighted graph and then utilize a pixel selection process to locate the anomaly targets. Two contributions are claimed in this paper: 1) no background distributions are required which makes the method more adaptive and 2) both the vertex and edge weights are considered which enables a more accurate detection performance and better robustness to noise. Intensive experiments on the simulated and real hyperspectral images demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other benchmark competitors. In addition, the robustness of the proposed method has been validated by using various window sizes. This experimental result also demonstrates the valuable characteristic of less computational complexity and less parameter tuning for real applications.

"Gaming addiction is usually characterized by a loss of control and mental instability, which may be particularly problematic in the military where task performance often requires optimal physical and mental functioning. No previous studies have thus far investigated levels of gaming addiction among conscripts. The aim of the present study was to assess the levels of gaming addiction among conscripts ( at the entry of service), and to investigate if indicators of lower psychosocial well-being ( particularly boredom, loneliness, depression, and anxiety) can help explain the variance in gaming addiction among conscripts. Lower psychosocial well-being has previously been related to gaming addiction in the general population, and coping with negative emotions has also been identified as a major motivation for gaming. The sample consisted of 1,017 conscripts ( 80.3% men) with a mean age of 19.5 years ( SD = 1.0). Results showed that 4.8% of the conscripts were addicted to gaming, and the addicted gamers scored significantly higher on boredom, loneliness, depression, and anxiety, compared with nonproblem gamers and nongamers. Results from hierarchical regression analyses showed that weekly time spent gaming explained most of the variance in gaming addiction ( 18.8%) whereas the indicators of low psychosocial well-being explained an additional 6.7% in Step 2, where depression, loneliness, and lack of external stimulation contributed significantly. Addiction is likely to have negative impact on training, operative ability, and task performance of the soldiers; hence a revision of the present selection criteria to include gaming addiction as an exclusion criterion for drafting may be warranted.

Participants completed the Narcissistic Personality Inventory and then evaluated hypothetical target persons. Target narcissism was conveyed through a single trait description (Study 1), a list of traits (Study 2), or Facebook content (Study 3). Narcissistic qualities were reliably viewed unfavorably, but narcissistic participants were comparatively less bothered by target narcissism and less positive in their judgments of targets without narcissistic qualities. In each study, symptoms of the presence or absence of narcissism had less impact on the social judgments of participants who were narcissistic.

"Problem. - Neurobiology, adorned with the most recent discoveries of the molecular biology, the genetics and the cognitive sciences, is present everywhere: In the report of the man with his body, with his intellectual faculties, with his perception of others and himself. Our social conducts, morality and our affects would be governed by neuronal substrata. Are things so simple? Methodology. - To try to answer this question, the author is going to use the opposition to explain and understand, in a long-standing and often passionate debate which concerns the epistemology and the ontology, two modalities to be inflexible. Different thus of methods: In the mind of Dilthey, we explain the nature (submitted to the principle of the causality) but we understand the psychic life (which sends back to the sphere of the sense). Results. - If the debate to explain and understand is further and far from being simple, the author adduces to draw from it some conclusions by questioning the speech of the promising of a reductionist neurobiology which believe to explain everything including all our actions in the name of the neurobiological reason: (1) if this is the case, we would be slaves of a history which already has its fate: The neurobiological-shaped man is neurobiological, (2) this speech is based on the mechanism of the tautology, that is it goes round in circles, teaches us absolutely nothing, (3) if the same neurobiologist asserts the opposite, why while reporting me what I say, I have no precise and localizable perception of my consciousness? (4) if the consciousness has no appropriate place or, to say it differently, if there is no intellectual topic appropriate to the consciousness, then what takes place in me will remain forever untranslatable and will be condemned to the silence. To go out of one, exist thus, I need the immediate and permanent help of an other one (or of contradiction), (5) if this process is purely an event of the brain then all our actions, all our gestures, in brief all that it is allowed us to live has to take place as it takes place, (6) finally to assert it brings us nothing more because the explanation always leaves something aside: the phenomenon of the life in which he is imperceptible. The example of the alcoholic is significant: if a change of the intellectual mechanisms is responsible of his alcohol addiction, why the alcoholic, by wanting to drink how everybody, makes as if written history beforehand was of not much importance? If the alcoholic began thinking of his own cerebral dysfunction while he lives, his life would have no shape. Indeed, if he receives the message and knows the felling about which it is a question. Indeed, if he receives the message and knows the feeling about which it is a question, he cannot, by force of circumstance, feel what his brain passes on to him: he does not witness what appears in its brain. On the other and he witnesses the world in which he lives but also on his condition of mortal. So, without objects to be cultivated, that is without the world of the presence which is the one of the existence and not the understanding, the neurobiological explanation of his alcohol addiction will concern a knowledge but will ignore any life. It means that there is well a gap to live and theorize and that the alcoholic is not reduced to a cerebral dysfunction: he is in the life of relation, that is it is capable of taking up himself by using its real-life experience. The psychopathology implications are going to show themselves here of a very big importance: any reduction comes to truncate the understanding of the man sick coach in reality we constantly have to deal with the global and complete man, with the anthropology of the human fate. Conclusion. - If the science brings us news discovered in this domain, it has to keep always in mind that the life remains imperceptible and deeply moving. Without this existential event which allows us to live, the air will become unbreathable in our more and more technical-scientific world: it would like being sentenced to asphyxiation.

"Two assumptions guide the current research. First, people's desire to see themselves as moral disposes them to make attributions that enhance or protect their moral self-image: When approached with a prosocial request, people are inclined to attribute their own noncompliance to external factors, while attributing their own compliance to internal factors. Second, these attributions can backfire when put to a material test. Studies 1 and 2 demonstrate that people who attribute their refusal of a prosocial request to an external factor (e.g., having an appointment), but then have that excuse removed, are more likely to engage in prosocial behavior than those who were never given an excuse to begin with. Study 3 shows that people view it as more morally reprehensible to no longer honor the acceptance of a prosocial request if an accompanying external incentive is removed than to refuse a request unaccompanied by an external incentive. Study 4 extends this finding and suggests that people who attribute the derision to behave prosocially to an internal factor despite the presence of an external incentive are more likely to continue to behave prosocially once the external incentive is removed than are those for whom no external incentive was ever offered. This research contributes to an understanding of the dynamics underlying the perpetuation of moral self-regard and suggests interventions to increase prosocial behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Unravelling the molecular mechanisms of disease manifestations is important to understand pathologies and symptom development in plant science. Bacteria have evolved different strategies to manipulate their host metabolism for their own benefit. This bacterial manipulation is often coupled with severe symptom development or the death of the affected plants. Determining the specific bacterial molecules responsible for the host manipulation has become an important field in microbiological research. After the identification of these bacterial molecules, called effectors, it is important to elucidate their function. A straightforward approach to determine the function of an effector is to identify its proteinaceous binding partner in its natural host via a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen. Normally the host harbors numerous potential binding partners that cannot be predicted sufficiently by any in silico algorithm. It is thus the best choice to perform a screen with the hypothetical effector against a whole library of expressed host proteins. It is especially challenging if the causative agent is uncultivable like phytoplasma. This protocol provides step-by-step instructions for DNA purification from a phytoplasma-infected woody host plant, the amplification of the potential effector, and the subsequent identification of the plant's molecular interaction partner with a Y2H screen. Even though Y2H screens are commonly used, there is a trend to outsource this technique to biotech companies that offer the Y2H service at a cost. This protocol provides instructions on how to perform a Y2H in any decently equipped molecular biology laboratory using standard lab techniques.

"Psychological research on prejudice against homosexuals distinguishes between old-fashioned (traditional) and modern (contemporary) homonegativity, which differ with regard to their content, correlates, and consequences. The current research offers evidence for the validity of old-fashioned versus modern homonegativity distinction in the post-communist, East European context. In Studies 1 and 2 (Ns = 295 and 327, respectively) the Polish adaptations of the non-gendered and gendered Homonegativity Scale (Morrison, Parriag, & Morrison, 1999) and the Modern Homonegativity Scale (Morrison & Morrison, 2003) were developed. Furthermore, divergent (discriminant) validity of traditional and contemporary anti-homosexual prejudice was demonstrated. Old-fashioned and modern homonegativity exhibited differential relationships with social distance and support for same-sex couples' relational rights.

"Objective: Emotion processing abilities might be reduced in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Previous studies of emotion processing in ALS have inconsistent results, and are limited by variations in task difficulty, modalities examined, and participants' cognitive status. The current study used a battery of emotion processing tasks at differing levels of difficulty and across different modalities (facial affect and voice prosody) to assess the extent of emotion processing deficits in nondemented ALS. Method: 33 ALS participants with intact basic cognition and 22 healthy controls completed the abbreviated Comprehensive Affect Testing System (CATS), which assesses simple and complex facial affect recognition, affective prosody recognition, cross-modal face-prosody integration, and semantic comprehension of affect. Participants also completed measures of executive function, mood, and functional impairment. Results: ALS participants showed impairments on complex facial affect recognition, affective prosody recognition, and cross-modal integration. In contrast, simple facial affect recognition and semantic comprehension of affect were intact. ALS participants did not have significant mood symptoms, and neither mood nor functional impairment was related to emotion processing. Performance on the cross-modal composite was related to executive function, however, this relationship was not apparent for facial or prosody recognition within a single modality. Conclusions: These results indicate that people living with ALS without dementia often have subtle difficulties with recognizing emotions in both faces and voices, even in the context of intact basic cognition. Clinicians should be aware of the potential for these emotion processing difficulties to be present in ALS and to affect interpersonal behavior and quality of life.

"Background: Alterations in gut microbiota composition and bacterial metabolites have been increasingly recognized to affect host metabolism and are at the basis of metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes (DM2). Intestinal enteroendocrine cells (EEC's) sense gut luminal content and accordingly secrete hormones that modulate glucose and lipid metabolism and affect satiety. It has become evident that microbial metabolic products significantly affect EEC function. Scope and approach: In this review, we will discuss current insights in the role of the gut microbiota and its metabolites in development of obesity and DM2 and elaborate on interventions that modulate EEC action. Key findings and conclusions: Studies including fecal transplantation and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in humans and animal models suggest that the gut microbiota and its metabolites causally contribute to development of obesity and DM2. Emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiota and its metabolites can modulate secretion of EEC hormones that regulate appetite and insulin secretion. Dispersed intestinal expression and low abundance make EEC's difficult to study. Since current intestinal sampling methods in humans are mostly limited to the colon, this leaves a large part of EEC function understudied. It would therefore be relevant to develop means to extend sampling methods throughout to entire GI tract. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"Although nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is well-established as a routine clinical imaging technique (magnetic resonance imaging or MRI), its application as a tool for metabolic investigations in humans is much less widespread in the medical community. To date, very few laboratories have combined the scientific interest, technical expertise (especially in vivo NMR spectroscopy), and facilities required to perform meaningful NMR studies of human metabolism. Among the few published reports of studies using in vivo NMR spectroscopy, diabetes mellitus, or more generally the physiology and pathophysiology of glucose homeostasis, is the dominant topic. This situation is related to the historical role of the Yale MR Center (R.G. Shulman, D.L Rothman) in the development of in vivo NMR, and to the collaboration of NMR methodologists with the Endocrinology Section of the Yale Medical School (G.I. Shulman). Thus, in the field of diabetes and metabolism, in vivo NMR has already contributed significantly to increasing our understanding of basic physiology as well as of pathophysiological mechanisms. This ''practical research note'' first describes the basic principles of in vivo NMR and provides practical information about the use of this technique in metabolic investigations. The metabolic parameters accessible through in vivo NMR are then reviewed and illustrated by a few examples from the literature.

"This article describes a creative design activity to introduce engineering students to mechatronic prototyping. Our goal was to find a creative task to increase student confidence and skills in mechanical design, electrical circuits, microcontrollers, and programming. We present the Paper Robot exercise, a design activity that blends everyday materials such as cardboard, with electronic components. This activity was introduced during the 2010-2011 academic year and has been repeated every year since, in a global, industry-sponsored design course at Stanford University. The Paper Robot exercise resulted from the observation that students were intimidated to create functional prototypes with microcontrollers. The teaching team needed a way to quickly introduce tools for programming electronic components and to encourage creative experimentation early in the course. Results include a 100% task performance rate of students that successfully made a robot meeting the minimum requirements. 76% of students reported an increase in knowledge in programming microcontrollers (Arduino), and 69% increased their knowledge in creating electronic circuits out of raw components. This activity may be modified to introduce younger students to mechatronic platforms in STEM education curriculum.

"With Donald Trump the Republican nominee and Hillary Clinton the Democratic nominee for the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, speculations of why Trump resonates with many Americans are widespread - as are suppositions of whether, independent of party identification, people might vote for Hillary Clinton. The present study, using a sample of American adults (n = 406), investigated whether two ideological beliefs, namely, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO) uniquely predicted Trump support and voting intentions for Clinton. Cognitive ability as a predictor of RWA and SDO was also tested. Path analyses, controlling for political party identification, revealed that higher RWA and SDO uniquely predicted more favorable attitudes of Trump, greater intentions to vote for Trump, and lower intentions to vote for Clinton. Lower cognitive ability predicted greater RWA and SDO and indirectly predicted more favorable Trump attitudes, greater intentions to vote for Trump and lower intentions to vote for Clinton.

"This study investigated the relationship between reading comprehension (RC), trait anxiety, and preoccupation with reading disability (RD) in 88 school children in Grades 3 through 5 and in their mothers. Children's trait anxiety had a significant direct negative relationship with RC and also mediated the association between preoccupation with RD and RC. Mothers' preoccupation with their children's RDs had a direct negative association with their children's RC. This association was also mediated through children's trait anxiety. No association was found between mothers' trait anxiety and children's RC. In a final model, RC was explained significantly by children's word reading fluency and trait anxiety as well as by their mothers' preoccupation with their children's RDs. This study extends our understanding of multicomponential models of RC by shedding light on the significant role played by anxiety- and preoccupation-related factors involving both children with RDs and their mothers.

"Criminal (drug and prostitution) charges, employment levels (weekly hours), recent substance use in the past 6 months, and primary sources of income were examined among a sample (n = 106) of women ex-offenders who had opioid use disorders with and without methadone histories. A general linear model was tested to examine differences in relation to methadone use history. Results from a one-way MANCOVA found that those with methadone histories reported significantly higher levels of drug and prostitution charges than those without any methadone history, but no significant differences in terms of weekly hours of employment or recent substance use were observed between groups. Women ex-offenders with methadone histories reported various sources of income beyond employment, and proportionally, more of these women reported prostitution as a primary source of income. Findings suggest that methadone maintenance treatments are not sufficient in meeting the needs of women ex-offenders.

"Background and Aim: Prosthetic CAD/CAM systems require accurate 3D limb models; however, difficulties arise when working from the person's socket since current 3D scanners have difficulties scanning socket interiors. While dedicated scanners exist, they are expensive and the cost may be prohibitive for a limited number of scans per year. A low-cost and accessible photogrammetry method for socket interior digitization is proposed, using a smartphone camera and cloud-based photogrammetry services. Technique: 15 two-dimensional images of the socket's interior are captured using a smartphone camera. A 3D model is generated using cloud-based software. Linear measurements were comparing between sockets and the related 3D models. Discussion: 3D reconstruction accuracy averaged 2.6 +/- 2.0 mm and 0.086 +/- 0.078 L, which was less accurate than models obtained by high quality 3D scanners. However, this method would provide a viable 3D digital socket reproduction that is accessible and low-cost, after processing in prosthetic CAD software.

"The main objective of this paper is to compare indicators based on energy consumption and financial savings to rank strategies to save potable water in buildings. The method is based on potable water savings, embodied energy, energy consumption for operation, and investment feasibility analysis; and it was applied to a school in the city of Florianopolis, southern Brazil. The strategies considered to save potable water were rainwater, greywater, water-efficient appliances, and their combinations. The embodied energy was estimated using indices of embodied energy per mass of material, and labour. The indicators used to rank the strategies were potential for potable water savings, index between potable water savings and embodied energy or total energy consumption, net present value, internal rate of return, discounted payback, and index between potable water savings and initial costs. All strategies and combinations were feasible, but the use of water-efficient appliances was the best. Amongst the indicators used to rank the strategies, five of them led to the same ranking. Such indicators can be applied to rank potable water saving strategies in other types of buildings and climates. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"The genus Roseburia consists of obligate Gram-positive anaerobic bacteria that are slightly curved, rod-shaped and motile by means of multiple subterminal flagella. It includes five species: Roseburia intestinalis, R. hominis, R. inulinivorans, R. faecis and R. cecicola. Gut Roseburia spp. metabolize dietary components that stimulate their proliferation and metabolic activities. They are part of commensal bacteria producing short-chain fatty acids, especially butyrate, affecting colonic motility, immunity maintenance and anti-inflammatory properties. Modification in Roseburia spp. representation may affect various metabolic pathways and is associated with several diseases (including irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, Type 2 diabetes, nervous system conditions and allergies). Roseburia spp. could also serve as biomarkers for symptomatic pathologies (e.g., gallstone formation) or as probiotics for restoration of beneficial flora.

"This paper presents the electrical characteristics of the gallium nitride (GaN) current aperture vertical electron transistor (CAVET) by using two-dimensional (2-D) technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulations. The CAVETs are considered as the alternative device due to their high breakdown voltage and high integration density in the high-power applications. The optimized design for the CAVET focused on the electrical performances according to the different gate-source length (L-GS) and aperture length (L-AP). We analyze DC and RF parameters inducing on-state current (I-on), threshold voltage (V-t), breakdown voltage (V-B), transconductance (g(m)), gate capacitance (C-gg) cut-off frequency (f(T)), and maximum oscillation frequency (f(max)).

"The purpose of this study is to propose a novel differential protection scheme for DC-AC converters. The current differential relay is widely used to protect transformers, generators, busbars and transmission lines. However, it cannot be applied to a DC-AC inverter, which is used in an AC-DC transmission line system. This paper presents a novel differential protection scheme for DC-AC converters, using Tellegen's Theorem. Tellegen's Theorem is a simple theorem of electric power proved from Kirchhoff's current law and Kirchhoff's voltage law. Under the theorem, we define three kinds of electric power as power flow. The proposed technique is evaluated using simulation studies based on an ideal inverter circuit which transforms DC to AC. The test results show the validity of the proposed protection.

"A global map of drought risk has been elaborated at the sub-national administrative level. The motivation for this study is the observation that little research and no concerted efforts have been made at the global level to provide a consistent and equitable drought risk management framework for multiple regions, population groups and economic sectors. Drought risk is assessed for the period 20002014 and is based on the product of three independent determinants: hazard, exposure and vulnerability. Drought hazard is derived from a non-parametric analysis of historical precipitation deficits at the 0.5; drought exposure is based on a non-parametric aggregation of gridded indicators of population and livestock densities, crop cover and water stress; and drought vulnerability is computed as the arithmetic composite of high level factors of social, economic and infrastructural indicators, collected at both the national and sub-national levels. The performance evaluation of the proposed models underlines their statistical robustness and emphasizes an empirical resemblance between the geographic patterns of potential drought impacts and previous results presented in the literature. Our findings support the idea that drought risk is driven by an exponential growth of regional exposure, while hazard and vulnerability exhibit a weaker relationship with the geographic distribution of risk values. Drought risk is lower for remote regions, such as tundras and tropical forests, and higher for populated areas and regions extensively exploited for crop production and livestock farming, such as South-Central Asia, Southeast of South America, Central Europe and Southeast of the United States. As climate change projections foresee an increase of drought frequency and intensity for these regions, then there is an aggravated risk for global food security and potential for civil conflict in the medium- to long-term. Since most agricultural regions show high infrastructural vulnerability to drought, then regional adaptation to climate change may begin through implementing and fostering the widespread use of irrigation and rainwater harvesting systems. In this context, reduction in drought risk may also benefit from diversifying regional economies on different sectors of activity and reducing the dependence of their GDP on agriculture.

"A study was carried out to estimate the actual evapotranspiration (ET) over a 1074 km(2) of the humid area of Perak State (Malaysia), where water and evaporation cycle deeply influences the climate, natural resources and human living aspects. Images from both Terra and Aqua platforms of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor were used for ET estimation by employing the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) model. As a part of the accuracy assessment process, in-situ measurements on soil temperature and reference ET (ET0) were recorded at the time of satellite overpass. In order to enhance the accuracy of the generated ET maps, MODIS images were subjected to sub-pixel analysis by assigning weights for different land surface cover (urban, agriculture and multi-surface areas) reflections. The weighting process was achieved by integrating ET from pure pixels with the respective site-specific ET0 of each land cover. The enhanced SEBAL model estimated ET exhibited a good correlation with the in-situ measured Penman-Montieth ET0, with R-2 values for the Aqua and the Terra platforms of 0.67 and 0.73, respectively. However, the correlation of the non-enhanced ET maps resulted in R-2 values of 0.61 and 0.68 for the Aqua and the Terra platforms, respectively. Hence, the results of this study revealed the feasibility of employing the sub-pixel analysis method for an accurate estimation of ET over large areas.

"We present THE-WIZZ, an open source and user-friendly software for estimating the redshift distributions of photometric galaxies with unknown redshifts by spatially cross-correlating them against a reference sample with known redshifts. The main benefit of THE-WIZZ is in separating the angular pair finding and correlation estimation from the computation of the output clustering redshifts allowing anyone to create a clustering redshift for their sample without the intervention of an 'expert'. It allows the end user of a given survey to select any subsample of photometric galaxies with unknown redshifts, match this sample's catalogue indices into a value-added data file and produce a clustering redshift estimation for this sample in a fraction of the time it would take to run all the angular correlations needed to produce a clustering redshift. We show results with this software using photometric data from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) and spectroscopic redshifts from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly survey and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The results we present for KiDS are consistent with the redshift distributions used in a recent cosmic shear analysis from the survey. We also present results using a hybrid machine learning-clustering redshift analysis that enables the estimation of clustering redshifts for individual galaxies.

"The study examined third-party listeners' ability to detect the Hellos spoken to prevalidated happy, neutral, and sad facial expressions. The average detection accuracies from the happy and sad (HS), happy and neutral (HN), and sad and neutral (SN) listening tests followed the average vocal pitch differences between the two sets of Hellos in each of the tests; HS and HN detection accuracies were above chance reflecting the significant pitch differences between the respective Hellos. The SN detection accuracy was at chance reflecting the lack of pitch difference between sad and neutral Hellos. As expected, the SN detection accuracy positively correlated with theory of mind; participating in these tests has been likened to the act of eavesdropping, which has been discussed from an evolutionary perspective. An unexpected negative correlation between the HS detection accuracy and the empathy quotient has been discussed with respect to autism research on empathy and pitch discrimination.

"In the present study, the copolymerization of ethyl acrylate and guar gum was induced by microwave irradiation in the presence of catalytic amount of the initiator potassium persulfate (KPS). The maximum percentage conversion was found to be 107.1% under microwave power of 900MW after 3min exposure. The copolymerized guar gum-graft-poly-ethyl acrylate (GG-g-PEA) was characterized using FTIR spectroscopy and SEM analysis. The effect of pH on the capacity of the GG-g-PEA copolymers to reduce the hardness of the water was investigated, leading to the effective removal of Ca(II) and Mg(II) ions from solutions at pH 8. The calculated values of the coefficient of determination (0.914-0.9553) for Ca(II) and Mg(II), respectively, showed that the equilibrium isotherm data followed the Freundlich isotherm model. The pseudo-second-order model was suitable for the modelling of the kinetic data, predicting adsorption capacities of 0.2680g/mg/min for Ca(II) and 0.3835g/mg/min for Mg(II), respectively. The synthesized GG-g-PEA adsorbent could therefore be recommended for the reduction in the water's hardness.

"How growth, microtubule dynamics, and cell-cycle progression are coordinated is one of the unsolved mysteries of cell biology. A maize mutant, tangled1, with known defects in growth and proper division plane orientation, and a recently characterized cell-cycle delay identified by time-lapse imaging, was used to clarify the relationship between growth, cell cycle, and proper division plane orientation. The tangled1 mutant was fully rescued by introduction of cortical division site localized TANGLED1-YFP. A CYCLIN1B destruction box was fused to TANGLED1-YFP to generate a line that mostly rescued the division plane defect but still showed cell-cycle delays when expressed in the tangled1 mutant. Although an intermediate growth phenotype between wild-type and the tangled1 mutant was expected, these partially rescued plants grew as well as wild-type siblings, indicating that mitotic progression delays alone do not alter overall growth. These data indicate that division plane orientation, together with proper cell-cycle progression, is critical for plant growth.

"The EU dependence on imported gas is increasing, rising to 67% in the year 2014 with 30% of total gas consumption used for electricity generation that year. With such a dependence on imported gas, gas supply interruptions can have significant impacts on the EU energy system and economy. This points to the need for integrated electricity and gas modelling tools to fully explore the potential impacts of gas supply interruptions. This paper builds and applies a detailed publically available integrated electricity and gas model for the EU-28. We use this model to examine a number of hypothetical scenarios where gas supply routes are interrupted for yearly periods and the impacts on power system operation and gas flow in Europe observed. Model results show that interruption of Russian gas supply to the EU could lead to a rise in average gas prices of 28% and 12% in electricity prices. When supply from North Africa was removed all Southern European states were affected heavily, Spain in particular saw large increases of 30% in gas prices with a corresponding rise of 18% in electricity prices as a result. In addition to supply interruptions, all gas storages were removed from the model to examine the importance of gas storage infrastructure. This resulted in an average increase in power prices of 6% across Europe. These additional insights offer an increased understanding of the interplay between the gas and power systems and identify challenges which may arise when seeking to understand energy systems as a whole.

"Tumor ablation by thermal, chemical and radiological sources has received substantial attention for the treatment of many localized malignancies. The primary goal of most ablation procedures is to eradicate all viable malignant cells within a designated target volume through the application of energy or chemicals. Methods such as radiotherapy, chemical and biological ablation, photodynamic therapy, cryoablation, high-temperature ablation (radiofrequency, microwave, laser, and ultrasound), and electric-based ablation have been developed for focal malignancies. In recent years a large volume of data emerged on the effect of in situ tumor destruction (ablation) on inflammatory and immune components resulting in systemic anti-tumor reactions. It is evident that in situ tumor ablation can involve tumor antigen release, cross presentation and the release of DAMPS and make the tumor its own cellular vaccine. Tumor tissue destruction by in situ ablation may stimulate antigen-specific cellular immunity engendered by an inflammatory milieu. Dendritic cells (DCs) attracted to this microenvironment, will undergo maturation after internalizing cellular debris containing tumor antigens and will be exposed to damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP). Mature DCs can mediate antigen-specific cellular immunity via presentation of processed antigens to T cells. The immunomodulatory properties, exhibited by in situ ablation could portend a future collaboration with immunotherapeutic measures. In this review are summarized and discuss the preclinical and clinical studies pertinent to the phenomena of stimulation of specific anti-tumor immunity by various ablation modalities and the immunology related measures used to boost this response.

"Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods allow high-order flow solutions on unstructured or locally refined meshes by increasing the polynomial degree and using curved instead of straight-sided elements. However, one of the currently largest obstacles to applying these methods to aerodynamic configurations of medium to high complexity is the availability of appropriate higher-order curved meshes. In this article, we describe a complete chain of higher-order unstructured grid generation and higherorder DG flow solution applied to a turbulent flow around a three-dimensional high-lift configuration. This includes (i) the generation of an appropriately coarse straight-sided mesh; (ii) the evaluation of additional points on the computer-aided design geometry of the curved-wall boundary for defining a piecewise polynomial boundary representation; (iii) a higher order mesh deformation to translate the curvature from the wall boundary into the interior of the computational domain; and (iv) the description of a DG discretization, which is sufficiently stable to allow a flow computation on the resulting curved mesh. Finally, a fourth-order flow solution of the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes and k-! turbulence model equations is computed on a fourth-order unstructured hybrid mesh around the three-dimensional high-lift simulation of wing-flow noise generation configuration.

"Fungi of the genus Trichosporon are increasingly recognized as causative agents of superficial and invasive fungal disease in humans. Although most species are considered commensals of the human skin and gastrointestinal tract, these basidiomycetes are an increasing cause of fungal disease among immunocompromised hosts, such as hematological patients and solid organ transplant recipients. The initiation of commensal or pathogenic programs by Trichosporon spp. involves the adaptation to the host microenvironment and its immune system. However, the exact virulence factors activated upon the transition to a pathogenic lifestyle, including the intricate biology of the cell wall, and how these interact with and subvert the host immune responses remain largely unknown. Here, we revisit our current understanding of the virulence attributes of Trichosporon spp., particularly T. asahii, and their interaction with the host immune system, and accommodate this knowledge within novel perspectives on fungal diagnostics and therapeutics.

"West coast of Taiwan belongs to alluvial plain, and has rich sediment delivery in early stage. Based on river sediment transport, sea wave, and wind affected, huge amount of sediment deposited in the river outlet to the sea. Coupled with the longshore sediment transport resulted, gradually to the formation of many small barrier islands along the coast. With the passage of time, there was more and more sediment deposition thus the formation of a watershed which we called lagoon as the inside sea. The lagoon connectivity within outside sea by the inlets which made inside sea water exchanged with outside sea water, not only refreshing the water quality but also enriching the ecosystem. The port facilities construction in light of the active and increasing demand of marine transit and international trading business, coupled with upper stream reservoirs construction and the down stream sand and gravel mining, create the river sediment transport declining and directly impact on coastal change and erosion problem. The barrier islands in Tainan coast have seriously eroded and decrease the elevation, gradually loss of natural flood detention function. The ecology and fishery resources of the lagoon face threats and coastal areas occurrence of flooding. The barrier islands shift to the land make the lagoon serious siltation; the elevation decreasing of the barrier islands make new inlets whenever the typhoons pass. The tidal current velocities changes due to the tidal movement, not only make the loss of barrier island, but also expand the width of inlet. This project is to restore the barrier islands in Wangye Port, Beimen, Tainan, and the construct changes the traditional beach nourishment construction method, and applying the geotextile tubes which donated by ACE Geosynthetics. The barrier islands locate in the south side of Chishui River's outlet to the sea, the total length about 6.5 km. From 1962-2002, a comprehensive erosion situation in the Beimen's coastline, 460m width beach disappear in north of Wangye Port, the average annual erosion up to 5.3m/year. The sea meteorological in Wangye Port has average tidal range of 1.03m, the average wave height about 1.1m, the 50-year return period of storm wave height is about 6.0 similar to 6.7 m. The width of inlet from 150 becomes to 200 m in half a year, and the velocity of inlet is about 2m/s. The traditional sand-fixed hedge and sand-dune vegetation engineering method can't resolve the issue of enlargement in the inlet. Coupled with the tidal current velocity with the tidal change in inlet, the restoration work must race against time to avoid new inlet formation due to the necking effect of inlet containment. In the past, people used geotextile bag which volume was 1m(3) to implement of restoration engineering. Low strength and less weight caused damage after the typhoon attacked. At present, we suggest using geotextile tube which circumference of 8.6 m and 50 m in length, not only the weight is 200 times to the original sandbag, but also is an efficient construction method. With the 400 horsepower dredge boat, 10 inch HDPE sediment transport pipes and link geotextile tube with 8 inch hose. A 50m long geotextile tube installation can be completed within two hours under the sediment transport efficient is about 150 m(3)/hr. After the installation of the geotextile tube, the bamboo piles in both side of geotextile tubes then backfill the sand, the total duration about one month. As a result, the backfill area has reached the total filling volume of 9500m(3) of sand source which is from the lagoon. The construction period, due to the inlet width gradually reduced, the seaward side of the beach has significant sediment deposition phenomenon. The lagoon known as the natural protective barrier has the call of marine reservoir, the inlet closed can completely solve the barrier island shift to the land and caused the inside sea siltation. The barrier islands play a natural detention flood, prevention disaster function. Results to corroborate the geotextile tube not only is applicable to solving the lagoon siltation and inlet closed but also offers speedy and friendly solution to deal with environmental and reinforcement barrier island without effecting the livelihood of fishermen and Oyster farmers'.

"Gastrokine 1 (GKN1) is highly expressed in gastric tissue and is secreted into the stomach but is not expressed in gastric cancer. GKN1 belongs to the BRICHOS domain family and plays a major role in maintaining gastric mucosa integrity. We previously demonstrated that a recombinant human GKN1 protein was able to interact with the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and was endowed with an antiamyloidogenic property because it inhibited polymerization of the A beta(1-40) peptide released from APP upon its partial hydrolysis. Here, we report that GKN1 can act as a physiological suppressor of A beta production in gastric cancer cells. GKN1 blocked the access of gamma-secretase to APP, thereby facilitating the cleavage of APP by alpha- and beta-secretases. GKN1 directly interacted with APP C-terminal fragments, C83 and C99. In addition, it did not affect gamma-secretase activity in gastric cancer cells because it did not alter Notchl processing. GKN1-mediated inhibition of APP processing might represent a new approach for the prevention and therapy of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

"Comparison is common in water management research: every table, map, and graph invites comparisons of different places and variables. Detailed international comparisons, however, seem infrequent in water resources research. To assess this perceived gap, this paper searched for examples of comparative research between two water sub-sectors in two countries using systematic bibliographic mapping procedures. It focused on rural and urban water conservation research in India and the United States. Search methods built upon procedures initially developed for the FAO Investment Centre and more advanced systematic review methods. The search generally confirmed that there have been few detailed comparative international studies on the subject of this review. Not surprisingly, there are a greater number of comparative studies between rural and urban water conservation within each country. The search also identified different conservation emphases in the two countries, e.g., rainwater harvesting in India compared with stormwater quality management in the United States. It identified unanticipated publications and lines of comparative water conservation (e.g. comparative physiology). Some transnational research goes beyond comparison to address the diffusion of innovations, i.e. research linkages as well as comparisons, although these studies are also few. The more prevalent pattern involves parallel literatures, which indicate substantial opportunities for future comparative and transnational research. This review also identified diffusion of international knowledge paths that are not the product of formal comparative research. The final section focuses on the prospects and priorities for future international and inter-sectoral research, e.g. paired multi-objective river basin research, linkages between climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction, diffusion of water conservation innovations, and synthesis of research on urban and rural rainwater harvesting in different countries.

"Traditional control charts, such as Hotelling's T-2, are effective in detecting abnormal patterns. However, most control charts do not take into account a time-varying property in a process. In the present study, we propose a parameter-less self-organizing map-based control chart that can handle a situation in which changes occur in the distribution or parameter of the target observations. The control limits of the proposed chart are determined by estimating the empirical level of significance on the percentile using the bootstrap method. Experimental results obtained by using simulated data and actual process data from the manufacturing process for a thin-film transistor-liquid crystal display demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed algorithm.

"Recognition of emotional expressions plays an essential role in children's healthy development. Anomalies in these skills may result in empathy deficits, social interaction difficulties and premorbid emotional problems in children and adolescents with schizophrenia. Twenty-six subjects with early onset schizophrenia spectrum (EOSS) disorders and twenty-eight matched healthy controls (HC) were instructed to identify five basic emotions and a neutral expression. The assessment entailed presenting visual, auditory and congruent cross-modal stimuli. Using a generalized linear mixed model, we found no significant association for handedness, age or gender. However, significant associations emerged for emotion type, perception modality, and group. EOSS patients performed worse than HC in uniand cross-modal emotional tasks with a specific negative emotion processing impairment pattern. There was no relationship between emotion identification scores and positive or negative symptoms, self-reported empathy traits or a positive history of developmental disorders. However, we found a significant association between emotional identification scores and nonverbal communication impairments. We conclude that cumulative dysfunctions in both nonverbal communication and emotion processing contribute to the social vulnerability and morbidity found in youths who display EOSS disorder.

"Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are regarded as promising therapeutic agents to treat addiction. The current study aimed to examine the effects of huperzine A, a cholinesterase inhibitor, on behavioral sensitization induced by repeated morphine administration and relapse induced by contextual conditioning. The present study also assessed whether the state-dependency hypothesis may explain the results. Adult rats were divided into four groups (n=8) and intraperitoneally injected with 0.2, 0.3 or 0.4 mg/kg huperzine A or saline (1 ml/kg, control), for 5 days. The effect of repeated huperzine A administration alone on locomotor activity was assessed. For the experiments that analyzed the development of morphine-induced sensitization, 40 rats were divided into five groups (n=8): Saline+Saline, Saline+Morphine, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 mg/kg huperzine A+Morphine. Following a withdrawal period of 7 days, all animals were administered saline or morphine, as appropriate. To test the state-dependency hypothesis, the rats in the Saline+Morphine group were injected with saline and morphine, while the other three groups were administered different doses of huperzine A and morphine. To examine the effect of huperzine A on the expression of morphine-induced sensitization, the rats in huperzine A+Morphine groups were injected with appropriate concentrations of huperzine A, and morphine. The current results indicated that the administration of huperzine A alone did not affect locomotor activity, while higher doses of huperzine A inhibited the addictive behavior induced by morphine at the development phase. Additionally, huperzine A administration during the expression phase of morphine sensitization did not inhibit the relapse induced by administration of saline. Furthermore, 0.4 mg/kg huperzine A inhibited the expression of morphine-induced behavioral sensitization. Therefore, the results of the current study do not support the state-dependency hypothesis.

"The treatment of renal failure has changed little in decades. Organ transplantation and dialysis continue to represent the only therapeutic options available. However, decades of fundamental research into the response of the kidney to acute injury and the processes driving progression to chronic kidney disease are beginning to open doors to new options. Similarly, continued investigations into the cellular and molecular basis of normal kidney development, together with major advances in stem cell biology, are now delivering options in regenerative medicine not possible as recently as a decade ago. In this review, we will discuss advances in regenerative medicine as it may be applied to the kidney. This will cover cellular therapies focused on ameliorating injury and improving repair as well as advancements in the generation of new renal tissue from stem/progenitor cells.

"The home automation is one of the most customers of electrical energy after the industry. Lighting represents on average about 15% of the annual electricity bill excluding gas and hot water. Different studies have been made to reduce the electrical energy consumption like automatic switching and time programming. But all these techniques have not an important rate in reducing the electrical energy consumption. So we note that an intelligent lighting which varies with the users need remains important source of economy of the energy. The intelligent lighting is obtained by using ambient intelligence (AmI). Multi agent System (MAS) have become the important paradigm to develop an ambient system because they have important characteristics like autonomy, proactivity and mobility to respond better to the main characteristic of ambient intelligence like the adaptability to the context. In this area, we propose an adaptive and intelligent lighting system in which each light source is represented by a software agent and the set of agents compose and coordinate their competences in order to illuminate a region with minimum energy consumption.

"Although perceived inconsistencies play a central role in how people understand the world, research on impression formation has largely neglected lay perceptions of inconsistency. The current research seeks to address this gap by investigating perceived inconsistencies between positive and negative information along the dimensions of warmth and competence. Using a memory-based measure of surprise, three studies found an expectancy-violation effect for behaviors that were incongruent with the valence of prior information. This effect generalized across warmth and competence, indicating that prior information along one dimension led to valence-congruent expectations along the other dimension. There was no evidence for valence asymmetries in expectancy-violations regardless of whether the impression dimension involved warmth or competence. A fourth study replicated these findings using a self-report measure of perceived inconsistency. Implications for research on person perception, attitudes, and cognitive consistency are discussed.

"Object co-segmentation aims to simultaneously segment common regions of interest from multiple images. It is of great importance to image classification, object recognition and image retrieval. One way to extract similar objects shared by multiple images is to construct a correlation function between image regions. In this paper, object co-segmentation is addressed based on weakly supervised data fusion. First, we integrate the image boundary information into weakly supervised clustering by adopting an efficient image segmentation algorithm with proved convergence. Feature learning as well as clustering are also incorporated into the proposed algorithm to establish a unified framework so that an optimal feature subspace with clustering-oriented methods is provided. Second, the shared object from multiple images is regarded as the procedure to search objects from heterogeneous data sources, which is formalized as data fusion problems. Using data fusion techniques, we present a novel method to evaluate the similarity between images, which facilitates the use of similar objects from multiple images. Finally, the two proposed object segmentation and co-segmentation algorithms are verified through publicly available datasets MSRA1000 and iCoseg. Experiments demonstrate that both algorithms are capable to achieve superior or comparable performance over the compared state-of-the-art segmentation methods in all tested datasets.

"Shore zones are transition areas (ecotones) between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Their function in the environment is crucial because they serve as buffer zones that capture pollutants and slow down erosion of reservoir and watercourse banks provided that they are managed properly. Research on a shore zone was conducted at the Msciwojow retention reservoir with an innovative water self-purification system. After several years of its operation, an increased phosphate concentration in the main part of the reservoir was reported. The mapping of the terrain's surface and modeling of hydrological processes in the direct catchment area of the said reservoir were done using the digital elevation model (DEM). The DEM was created from LiDAR data obtained in 2012 by airborne laser scanning. Analyses of the surface runoff led to identification of surface runoff transport pathways, along which the eroded material from cultivated fields is discharged directly to the reservoir. Surface runoff transport pathways gather the eroded material from a maximum area of 45,000 m(2) in the western part of the direct catchment and 40,000 m(2) in the eastern part of it. Due to the reservoir management negligence, the riparian zone designed for the Msciwojow Reservoir no longer exists. The percentage of the natural shore that undergoes erosion processes is over 54. The said processes and fluctuations of the water level in the reservoir, as well as degradation of the shore zone caused by human activity, bring about limited plant development in the littoral zone, which in turn lowers the reservoir's resistance to degradation.

"In this paper, two two-party quantum key agreement protocols are proposed with logical chi-states and logical Bell states. These two protocols can be immune to the collective-dephasing noise and the collective-rotation noise, respectively. They make full use of the measurement correlation property of multi-particle entangled states and the delayed measurement technique. This ensures that two participants can exchange the secret keys of each other and fairly establishes a shared key. There is no information leakage problem when establishing a shared key. The use of the delayed measurement technique and the decoy state technology makes the two protocols resist against both participant and outsider attacks. Furthermore, the two protocols are congenitally free from the Trojan horse attacks and have high qubit efficiency.

"X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) has been associated with a broad range of infections, but enteroviral disease represents one of the most damaging infections. The risk of enteroviral infection in XLA is lower now than in the setting of intramuscular immunoglobulin or in patients without immunoglobulin replacement, but the rate of infection has not declined significantly in the era of intravenous immunoglobulin replacement. Enteroviruses can cause inflammation of nearly every organ, but in XLA, infections often manifest as dermatomyositis or chronic meningoencephalitis. Difficulty and delay in recognizing symptoms and lack of specific therapy contribute to the poor outcomes. Furthermore, cerebrospinal fluid detection of enteroviruses is not very sensitive. Reluctance to perform brain biopsies can lead to significant delays. The other feature compromising outcomes is the lack of specific therapy. High-dose peripheral and intraventricular immunoglobulin have been used, but failure is still common. New antienteroviral drugs are in development and show promise for immunodeficient patients with life-threatening infections with enterovirus.

"The design of flow machines is still a difficult task, mainly due to the large number of free geometrical parameters involved. Thus, design optimization techniques can be applied to obtain optimized designs of these machines. This work deals with optimization of radial flow machine rotors (pumps and turbine), where a novel methodology for the propeller design is proposed based on the topology optimization method which distributes fluid or solid in a design domain to extremize a defined objective function subjected to some constraints. The design objective is to optimize the shape of the channel between two blades of the rotor to minimize the energy dissipation and vorticity, and minimize or maximize the power in the case of a pump or turbine, respectively. These objective functions are combined in a multi-objective function. A two-dimensional finite element is derived in a rotating frame for modelling the rotor flow behaviour. The modelling predicts the flow field between relative two blades of a rotor without considering the influence of the volute. It is assumed that the fluid is flowing in an idealized porous medium subjected to a friction force, which is proportional to the fluid velocity and the inverse local permeability. A porous flow model is introduced with a continuous (grey) permeability design variable for each element that defines the local permeability of the medium and allows the transition between fluid and solid property. The design optimization problem is solved by using the method of moving asymptotes (MMA). Numerical examples are presented to illustrate this methodology. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"Despite the widespread inclusion of diversity-related curricula in U.S. medical training, racial disparities in the quality of care and physician bias in medical treatment persist. The present study examined the effects of both formal and informal experiences on non-African American medical students' (N = 2,922) attitudes toward African Americans in a longitudinal study of 49 randomly selected U.S. medical schools. We assessed the effects of experiences related to medical training, accounting for prior experiences and attitudes. Contact with African Americans predicted positive attitudes toward African Americans relative to white people, even beyond the effects of prior attitudes. Furthermore, students who reported having witnessed instructors make negative racial comments or jokes were significantly more willing to express racial bias themselves, even after accounting for the effects of contact. Examining the effects of informal experiences on racial attitudes may help develop a more effective medical training environment and reduce racial disparities in healthcare.

"Some children with Down syndrome may experience difficulties in recognizing facial emotions, particularly fear, but it is not clear why, nor how such skills can best be facilitated. Using a photo-matching task, emotion recognition was tested in children with Down syndrome, children with nonspecific intellectual disability and cognitively matched, typically developing children (all groups N = 21) under four conditions: veridical vs. exaggerated emotions and emotion-labelling vs. generic task instructions. In all groups, exaggerating emotions facilitated recognition accuracy and speed, with emotion labelling facilitating recognition accuracy. Overall accuracy and speed did not differ in the children with Down syndrome, although recognition of fear was poorer than in the typically developing children and unrelated to emotion label use. Implications for interventions are considered.

"Satellite remote sensing platforms can collect measurements on a global scale within a few days, which provides an unprecedented opportunity to characterize and understand the spatio-temporal variability of environmental variables. Because of the additional challenges of making precise and accurate measurements from space, it is essential to validate satellite remote sensing datasets with highly precise and accurate ground-based measurements. The focus of this article is on two sets of measurements: Atmospheric column-averaged carbon dioxide (CO2) collected by the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) mission in its target mode of operation; and ground-based data used for validation from the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON). The current statistical modeling of the relationship between the less-precise OCO-2 satellite data (17) and the more-precise TCCON ground -based data (X) assumes a linear regression and heteroscedattic measurement errors that reside in both the OCO-2 data and the TCCON data. To obtain consistent estimates of the regression coefficients, it is critical to determine the error variance of each datum in the regression. In this article, a rigorous statistical procedure is presented for obtaining these error variances through modeling the spatial and/or temporal dependence structure in the OCO-2 and TCCON datasets. Numerical results for analyzing data at the Lamont TCCON station and the corresponding OCO-2 target-mode data (orbit number 3590) illustrate our procedure.

"Demand for green energy production is arising all over the world. A lot of emphasis is laid in making the buildings green. Even a small amount of energy savings made contribute to saving the environment. In this study, an idea is proposed and studied to extract power from the high head water in the pipelines of a building. A building of height 15 m is considered for this study. Water flowing in the pipe has sufficient energy to run a micro hydro turbine. The feasibility of producing electrical energy from the energy of pipe water is found. The motivation is to find the feasibility of generating power using a low-cost turbine. The experimental setup consists of micro turbine of 135 mm diameter coupled to a 12-V DC generator; LEDs and resistors are employed to validate the results. The theoretical calculations were presented using the fundamental equations of fluid mechanics. The theoretical results are validated using experimental and numerical results using CFD simulation. In addition, exergy analysis has been carried out to quantify the irreversibilities during the process in the system.

"Conventional planar transistor shows shrinking substrate bias effect at scaled technology. On the other hand, epitaxial delta-doped channel (EDC) transistor shows substantial amount of substrate bias effect even at 16-nm channel length. This paper unveils the physics behind the substrate bias effect of an n-channel EDC transistor through Technology Computer Aided Design simulation with analytical justifications. The depletion width for an EDC transistor very weakly depends upon the applied substrate bias, and with scaling down of channel length, the depletion width insignificantly gets widened. The substrate control over the channel is high so that significant amount of substrate depletion charge terminates on the gate, instead of on the source and the drain. The degradation of threshold voltage roll off and drain-induced barrier lowering coefficient with the increase of substrate bias, is less for the EDC transistor, compared to that of a conventional halo free transistor. The dependence of the substrate bias sensitivity on the thickness of the low-doped epitaxial layer and concentration of the high-doped layer is explored. The effects of reverse substrate bias on leakage power dissipation and intrinsic delay of EDC and conventional transistors are discussed.

"Recent studies have established resident memory T cells (T-RM) as the dominant memory lymphocyte population surveying most nonlymphoid tissues. Unlike other memory T cell lineages, T-RM do not recirculate through blood and are permanently confined to their tissue of residence. T-RM orchestrate local immune responses and have been shown to accelerate local pathogen control in many experimental infection models. Here we briefly summarize recent advances in T-RM differentiation, maintenance, and their protective function. While little is known, we have speculated on the potential implications of T-RM for transplantation biology. Areas of emphasis include the role of passenger T-RM in controlling latent viral recrudescence in donor organs, donor T-RM as a source of graft-versus-host disease, the ability of T-RM to potently induce inflammation through sensing and alarm functions, and differentiation of host T cells into T-RM in response to local cues inside the allograft. Further investigation of T-RM in the context of transplantation might identify therapeutic targets to prolong graft survival. This review discusses the phenotype, function, and potential relevance for transplantation of resident memory T cells.

"This research explores interactions among Mexican immigrants and their U.S.- and Mexican-born allies at an immigrant support center (ISC) in the U.S. Southwest. I propose that to support Mexican immigrants in resettling, allies who work at this ISC must apply cultural knowledge about competent communication for Mexican speakers to structure their strategic actions (Sprain & Boromisza-Habashi, 2013). Taking an ethnography of communication (EOC) approach, I investigate the means and meanings of communication (Hymes, 1972) for speakers that point to cultural knowledge about competent communication. Data for this study include 7 months of observation, interviews with 37 community and staff members, and public documents collected during fieldwork. Findings reveal five means of communication that are meaningful for speakers at ISC. This research demonstrates the practical utility of the EOC in understanding how cultural expectations for communication may both assist and limit ISC's efforts to support resettlement.

The presentation substantially follows [6,15] with regard to personal biographical details by Ferdinand Redtenbacher himself, [1,22-33], essays by contemporary witnesses in [7,9-12,34] (but not so much [2], see [40]) as well as historical appraisals in [13,14,37,38]. It starts with a description of his life covering his childhood and early teens in his home in Upper Austria, through the culmination of his professional career as a professor and the director of the Polytechnic school in Karlsruhe, Germany (today the University of Karlsruhe). Of particular interest is the question of which external circumstances and characters helped to establish the path of Redtenbacher's lifework and how his influence pushed the German manufacturing engineering in the 20th century and even today. Finally this paper explores Redtenbacher's contributions to mechanism and machine science by means of his construction of kinematic models for teaching. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"Social Perception and Social Reality (Jussim 2012) reviews the evidence in social psychology and related fields and reaches three conclusions: (1) Although errors, biases, and self-fulfilling prophecies in person perception are real, reliable, and occasionally quite powerful, on average, they tend to be weak, fragile, and fleeting. (2) Perceptions of individuals and groups tend to be at least moderately, and often highly accurate. (3) Conclusions based on the research on error, bias, and self-fulfilling prophecies routinely greatly overstate their power and pervasiveness, and consistently ignore evidence of accuracy, agreement, and rationality in social perception. The weight of the evidence -including some of the most classic research widely interpreted as testifying to the power of biased and self-fulfilling processes - is that interpersonal expectations relate to social reality primarily because they reflect rather than cause social reality. This is the case not only for teacher expectations, but also for social stereotypes, both as perceptions of groups, and as the bases of expectations regarding individuals. The time is long overdue to replace cherry-picked and unjustified stories emphasizing error, bias, the power of self-fulfilling prophecies, and the inaccuracy of stereotypes, with conclusions that more closely correspond to the full range of empirical findings, which includes multiple failed replications of classic expectancy studies, metaanalyses consistently demonstrating small or at best moderate expectancy effects, and high accuracy in social perception.

"Loudspeakers line arrays are very common reproduction sound systems used in real environments (e.g., theaters, stadiums, cinemas, and conference halls) for synthesizing the directivity characteristics of a linear source. The sound field emitted by a vertical line array can be pointed in a particular direction by using digital signal processing techniques and avoiding any mechanical movements. The approach proposed in this paper to obtain the desired directivity behavior takes advantage of the reproduction of a virtual source with frequency-independent directivity characteristics using wave field synthesis theory and introducing a computational complexity reduction. A full investigation on the performance of the technique has been carried out making comparisons with other approaches proposed in the literature thus providing an overview of the results achievable with digital steering of line arrays.

"Subcritical flow in a short expansion tends to become detached from its sidewalls and create turbulent eddies. This phenomenon can cause undesirable losses of flow energy and channel erosion. This paper numerically investigates the effects of a triangular hump fitted at the bottom of the expansion on flow separation reduction. The results are validated using available experimental data. This paper reports quantitative details of the velocity field, eddy structures, and flow streamline separation in expansions of different divergence angles under various conditions of the Froude number. The results show that the flow of water can separate along either of the two sidewalls, possibly due to bistability. The use of appropriate humps can effectively reduce separation and turbulent eddies because they force the flow to accelerate and hence create a favorable pressure gradient. The results from this paper are useful for the optimal design of expansions as an important part of irrigation and water systems.

"Background: Breast fibromatosis is a rare disease characterized by monoclonal fibroblast proliferation. It has no ability to metastasize but has a high local recurrence rate and often infiltrates surrounding tissues. Surgical treatment is the reference, but recently, new targeted therapies have emerged. We report an original case of a patient with breast fibromatosis who received exclusive medical treatment. Our aim was to analyze these treatments based on the clinical and radiological outcome, iatrogenic effects, and pharmacological action. Case presentation: We report the case of a 19-year-old woman who developed a desmoid-type fibromatosis of the lower inner quadrant of the right breast, measuring 50 x 25 mm (i.e., a volume of 27.4 cm(3)). Initial surgery was not possible because of potential esthetic and functional prejudice. Thus, she had an exclusive medical treatment including several lines: NSAIDs with tamoxifen and triptorelin, followed by sorafenib, then interferon a2b, and finally sunitinib. With tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (sunitinib), a significant partial response was observed (57% reduction of the maximal tumoral volume). For each treatment, we provided the clinical and radiological outcome in association with known pharmacological action. Conclusions: TKI had been an interesting alternative option to initial surgery, providing at least a partial response and potentially allowing less mutilating surgery. However, no pharmacological mechanism can unequivocally explain TKI efficacy. In general, breast fibromatosis should be treated along with oncologist and interventional radiologists in a trans-disciplinary modality, thus offering an adapted treatment for this particular desmoid-type fibromatosis localization.

"Multiple system atrophy is a fatal sporadic adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder with no symptomatic or disease-modifying treatment available. The cytopathological hallmark of multiple system atrophy is the accumulation of alpha-synuclein aggregates in oligodendrocytes, forming glial cytoplasmic inclusions. Impaired insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 signalling (IGF-1) and insulin resistance (i.e. decreased insulin/IGF-1) have been reported in other neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Increasing evidence also suggests impaired insulin/IGF-1 signalling in multiple system atrophy, as corroborated by increased insulin and IGF-1 plasma concentrations in multiple system atrophy patients and reduced IGF-1 brain levels in a transgenic mouse model of multiple system atrophy. We here tested the hypothesis that multiple system atrophy is associated with brain insulin resistance and showed increased expression of the key downstream messenger insulin receptor substrate-1 phosphorylated at serine residue 312 in neurons and oligodendrocytes in the putamen of patients with multiple system atrophy. Furthermore, the expression of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) phosphorylated at serine residue 312 was more apparent in inclusion bearing oligodendrocytes in the putamen. By contrast, it was not different between both groups in the temporal cortex, a less vulnerable structure compared to the putamen. These findings suggest that insulin resistance may occur in multiple system atrophy in regions where the neurodegenerative process is most severe and point to a possible relation between alpha-synuclein aggregates and insulin resistance. We also observed insulin resistance in the striatum of transgenic multiple system atrophy mice and further demonstrate that the glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue exendin-4, a well-tolerated and Federal Drug Agency-approved antidiabetic drug, has positive effects on insulin resistance and monomeric alpha-synuclein load in the striatum, as well as survival of nigral dopamine neurons. Additionally, plasma levels of exosomal neural-derived IRS-1 phosphorylated at serine residue 307 (corresponding to serine residue 312 in humans) negatively correlated with survival of nigral dopamine neurons in multiple system atrophy mice treated with exendin-4. This finding suggests the potential for developing this peripheral biomarker candidate as an objective outcome measure of target engagement for clinical trials with glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues in multiple system atrophy. In conclusion, our observation of brain insulin resistance in multiple system atrophy patients and transgenic mice together with the beneficial effects of the glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist exendin-4 in transgenic mice paves the way for translating this innovative treatment into a clinical trial.

"From an ecological perspective, the nature of rainwater harvesting with the characteristics of artificial disturbance is a manual disturbance. So it is very important to confirm the degree of ecological disturbance that occurs due to rainwater harvesting. Drawing from ecological disturbance theory, we can utilize both the distance method and dynamic curve method to estimate the level of ecological disturbance and degree of rainwater harvesting with a historical reference point value of the environment as a frame of reference, and with the 20 indicators such as surface runoff and evaluation index. Our examples show that the distance method and dynamic curve method are feasible for evaluating the ecological disturbance degree of rainwater harvesting. There are also research-scale effects in the study of ecological disturbance of rainwater harvesting that embody the comparability of different spatial and temporal ecological disturbance degrees. The comparability of ecological disturbance degrees of rainwater harvesting in an area at different scales or in different areas at the same scales is not strong, but it also generates some useful reference values. The ecological disturbance measurement in the same study area and at the same research-scale at different historical periods can be compared.

"Printed carbon graphite materials are the primary common component in the majority of screen printed sensors. Screen printing allows a scalable manufacturing solution, accelerating the means by which novel sensing materials can make the transition from laboratory material to commercial product. A common bottleneck in any thick film printing process is the controlled drying of the carbon paste material. A study has been undertaken which examines the interaction between material solvent, printed film conductivity and process consistency. The study illustrates that it is possible to reduce the solvent boiling point to significantly increase process productivity while maintaining process consistency. The lower boiling point solvent also has a beneficial effect on the conductivity of the film, reducing the sheet resistance. It is proposed that this is a result of greater film stressing increasing charge percolation through greater inter particle contact. Simulations of material performance and drying illustrate that a multi layered printing provides a more time efficient manufacturing method. The findings have implications for the volume manufacturing of the carbon sensor electrodes but also have implications for other applications where conductive carbon is used, such as electrical circuits and photovoltaic devices.

"Hydroinformatics emerged in 1991 when numerical modelling of water expanded its range from one that was restricted to the modelling of flows to a much wider ranging sociotechnical discipline that supports stakeholders in addressing their water-related problems. However, despite numerous advances in hydroinformatics, the current practical and research effort is still very much technocratic (or techno-centric) which in turn may restrict the potential of hydroinformatics in its scope and its reach. This Special Issue, through the compilation of thirteen papers, illustrates some of the developments and applications in the field of hydroinformatics and marks the twenty-five years of its existence. We hope that this will help to further raise the awareness of the subject and its developments and applications. In the Editorial of this Special Issue, we briefly discuss the origin of hydroinformatics and we introduce the papers that are featuring in this Special Issue. We also give a way forward for future research and application.

"Receiving an average 3000mm of rainfall depth with high intensity, Malaysia is known as a tropical climate country. Currently, Malaysia proactively promotes the use of Sustainable Urban Drainage Syatem (SUDS) as indicated in the Malaysian's Stormwater Management Manual namely the Urban Stormwater Management Manual of Malaysia (MSMA) 1st and 2nd version. The manual is promoting the implementation of SUDS facilities whether as a single facility or integrated ones which is a combination of two or more SUDS facilities. However green roof is not included in this manual. Thus the objectives of this paper are to share the preliminary study of intensive green roof tested under high intensity rainfall (159mm/hr) using rainfall simulator and four intensive green roof test bed with different vegetations. Three species selected for each test bed namely Kalanchoe pinnata (K. pinnata), Axonopus compressus (A. compressus) and Arachis pintoi (A. pintoi). Another test bed is to leave in a baren condition without vegetation as a control unit. Media or substrate use for these test beds are similar which consists of drainage cells, geotextile, river sand and top soils. Parameters studied are potassium (K), Total Phosphate (TP), Total Nitrogen (TN) and Ammoniacal Nitrogen (AN). Results show that K. pinnata performed well in the reduction of TP (37.50% - 89%) and AN (68.90% - 95.34%) followed by A. pintoi(TP: 36.68% - 82.50%, AN: 59.92% - 92.68%) and A. compressus (TP: 20.11% - 80.15%, AN: 89.52% - 93.44%). Another studied parameters (K and TN) show leaching in outflow of test bed. It is believed due to the fertilizer used for plant growth. In term of quantity control, all test beds showed reduction percentage of runoff hydrograph in the range of 9% to 67.

"Background and Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the internal and marginal fit of chrome cobalt (Co-Cr) crowns were fabricated with laser sintering, computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing, and conventional methods. Materials and Methods: Polyamide master and working models were designed and fabricated. The models were initially designed with a software application for three-dimensional (3D) CAD (Maya, Autodesk Inc.). All models were fabricated models were produced by a 3D printer (EOSINT P380 SLS, EOS). 128 1-unit Co-Cr fixed dental prostheses were fabricated with four different techniques: Conventional lost wax method, milled wax with lost-wax method (MWLW), direct laser metal sintering (DLMS), and milled Co-Cr (MCo-Cr). The cement film thickness of the marginal and internal gaps was measured by an observer using a stereomicroscope after taking digital photos in x24. Results: Best fit rates according to mean and standard deviations of all measurements was in DLMS both in premolar (65.84) and molar (58.38) models in mm. A significant difference was found DLMS and the rest of fabrication techniques (P 0.05). No significant difference was found between MCo-CR and MWLW in all fabrication techniques both in premolar and molar models (P 0.05). Conclusion: DMLS was best fitting fabrication techniques for single crown based on the results.The best fit was found in marginal; the larger gap was found in occlusal.All groups were within the clinically acceptable misfit range.

"This paper presents research results of the German-Namibian joint research project CuveWaters in which different technologies for small-scale rain- and floodwater harvesting were introduced as pilot plants in central-northern Namibia as part of a broader Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) approach. Central-northern Namibia has semi-arid climate conditions with clearly distinctive dry and wet seasons. Rain-and floodwater harvesting for irrigation purposes are intended to increase resilience in agricultural production by building buffers for interseasonal dry spells and to make irrigation farming possible during the dry season. This is intended to improve availability of vegetables in rural parts of Namibia and to derive income on local markets. Besides raising temperatures, climate change in sub-Saharan Africa is predicted to increase rainfall variability. Therefore, these adaptations also present a precondition for adapting to future climate change. Within the project, different organisational approaches such as harvesting of rainwater at the household as well as at the communal level were tested, as well as different locally available tank construction materials. All technologies were developed in cooperation with the local communities and framed by capacity development measures which yielded very good results and enabled a diffusion of the technology in the region. Based on 5 years of research the construction of ferrocement tanks on the household level and ponds covered with shade nets on the communal level can be recommended. Due to high evaporation rates all gardens irrigated with harvested rainwater were equipped with water saving drip irrigation systems. In combination with capacity development focusing on water management this enabled the users to irrigate their gardens throughout the dry season.

"Background: Recent epidemiologic studies have revealed a significant association between periodontitis and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Furthermore, periodontitis is markedly associated with orodigestive cancer mortality, whereas Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) infection has been identified as a specific and potentially independent microbial factor related to increased risk of orodigestive cancer death. The authors previously reported that Pg induced the precursor form of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (proMMP-9) production via proteinase-activated receptor (PAR)-related pathways, after which proMMP-9 was activated by gingipains to enhance cellular invasion of SAS cells. In the present study, effects of selected polyphenols as inhibitors of cellular invasion caused by Pg gingipains in SAS cells are examined. Methods: OSCC cells were infected with Pg strains including gingipain mutants. To evaluate effects of inhibitors: 1) apple polyphenol (AP); 2) hop bract polyphenol (HBP); 3) high-molecular-weight fractions of HBP (HMW-HBP); 4) low-molecular-weight fractions of HBP (LMW-HBP); 5) epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg); 6) KYT-1 (Arg-gingipain inhibitor); and KYT-36 (Lys-gingipain inhibitor) in combination are used. PAR2 and PAR4 mRNA expressions are examined using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and signaling pathways are evaluated by western blotting analysis. Results: KYT-1/KYT-36, AP, HBP, and HMW-HBP significantly inhibited PAR2 and PAR4 mRNA expressions, proMMP-9 activation, and cellular invasion. Furthermore, AP, HBP, and HMW-HBP reduced activation of heat shock protein 27 and Ets1 and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B, whereas EGCg and LMW-HBP did not. Conclusion: These results suggest that AP, HBP, HMW-HBP are potent inhibitors of proMMP-9 activation and cellular invasion mediated with Pg in OSCC cells.

"Two studies examined whether social identity processes, i.e. group identification and social identity threat, amplify the degree to which people attend to social category information in early perception [assessed with event-related brain potentials (ERPs)]. Participants were presented with faces of Muslims and non-Muslims in an evaluative priming task while ERPs were measured and implicit evaluative bias was assessed. Study 1 revealed that non-Muslims showed stronger differentiation between ingroup and outgroup faces in both early (N200) and later processing stages (implicit evaluations) when they identified more strongly with their ethnic group. Moreover, identification effects on implicit bias were mediated by intergroup differentiation in the N200. In Study 2, social identity threat (vs control) was manipulated among Muslims. Results revealed that high social identity threat resulted in stronger differentiation of Muslims from non-Muslims in early (N200) and late (implicit evaluations) processing stages, with N200 effects again predicting implicit bias. Combined, these studies reveal how seemingly bottom-up early social categorization processes are affected by individual and contextual variables that affect the meaning of social identity. Implications of these results for the social identity perspective as well as social cognitive theories of person perception are discussed.

"Drill stem vibration may cause drilling inefficiencies and often leads to non-productive time. Drill stem vibration analysis is performed to prevent and identify RPM values that may cause damaging standing waves in the drill stem. However, different models and assumptions give different vibration results. One simplification commonly done is excluding drilling fluids. This paper investigates the effect of including drilling hydraulics and the dynamic pressure on drill stem vibrations. The model assumes the drill stem is acting as a Euler Bernoulli beam and was discretized using a finite element formulation. Two fluid rheological models, Herschel Bulkley and Power Law, were used to determine the uncoupled dynamic pressure drop across the drill stem. The results show that including the dynamic pressure in the drill stem vibration model causes the critical rotational speeds to change as much as 32% (i.e. 59 RPM). As expected, axial and torsional vibrations are not affected, while lateral vibration changes significantly when the ratio of the wellbore diameter to the drill stem outside diameter is below 1.25, with a narrow total drill bit flow area, or when operating at high flow rates. Therefore, when creating RPM road maps to avoid vibrations while drilling, the contribution of the dynamic pressure should be included. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"Over several years, the trend of e-learning study has spread to all levels of education. The benefits of this trend are undeniable. When studying using e-learning materials students are connected to the internet and therefore they are able to trace quickly and easily additional information that are not given in the text or are is not explained adequately. It has a positive impact on students and their development of independence, creativity and in some cases is possible that the student does not even notice she/he is educating herself/him. Of course, this method has disadvantages such as e.g. health problems from frequent sitting at the computer, problems with social skills and communication, etc. Despite this, the method of teaching is certainly indispensable to the future and certainly it will replace the existing system partly or even completely. Unfortunately, the implementation of this trend is not so simple and faces many obstacles at all levels of education. In theoretical fields such as philosophy and human sciences, the creation of e-learning materials is easier. Lecture notes that are taught in the form of very long texts written on the blackboard or in the form of dictation during lectures are redesigned into electronic form and are supplemented by simple interactive elements that are used to test the students during studies. In technical fields such as machine design, the automotive industry, metallurgy, machining, etc. we face problems when in the course of teaching we must combine theoretical information, practical principles and industrial practices. But merging theory and practice creates a big problem when developing electronic interactive study materials which should be identical to the feelings that students will gain on a real example. Therefore our Department of Machine Design at the University of West Bohemia focused on this problem and conducted research of software tools that can be used to create educational materials. We sought inspiration not only online, but also from colleagues at other universities and in industry. The paper describes some of these tools and processes, including their advantages and disadvantages and it should be used as inspiration for other colleagues that are also focusing on this problem.

"Perceivers extractmultiple social dimensions from another's face (e. g., race, emotion), and these dimensions can become linked due to stereotypes (e. g., Black individuals. angry). The current research examined the neural basis of detecting and resolving conflicts between top-down stereotypes and bottom-up visual information in person perception. Participants viewed faces congruent and incongruent with stereotypes, via variations in race and emotion, while neural activity was measured using fMRI. Hand movements en route to race/emotion responses were recorded using mouse-tracking to behaviorally index individual differences in stereotypical associations during categorization. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) showed stronger activation to faces that violated stereotypical expectancies at the intersection of multiple social categories (i.e., race and emotion). These regions were highly sensitive to the degree of incongruency, exhibiting linearly increasing responses as race and emotion became stereotypically more incongruent. Further, the ACC exhibited greater functional connectivity with the lateral fusiform cortex, a region implicated in face processing, when viewing stereotypically incongruent (relative to congruent) targets. Finally, participants with stronger behavioral tendencies to link race and emotion stereotypically during categorization showed greater dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation to stereotypically incongruent targets. Together, the findings provide insight into how conflicting stereotypes at the nexus of multiple social dimensions are resolved at the neural level to accurately perceive other people.

"Water pollution can occur with a variety of reasons such as the change in water colour, the presence of harmful bacteria and toxic waste spills. This paper presents an application of an optical tomography system based on artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the turbidity level of water sample. The system made use of the independent component analysis algorithm to calculate the K value, which indicates the attenuation value of the water turbidity level. The K value then is utilized by ANN to estimate the turbidity level. The optical tomography system can be used to evaluate the water turbidity level in the pipeline without disturbing the flow process. Evaluation of the mean square error (MSE), sum square error (SSE) and regression analysis (R) also enabled us to determine the network performance which demonstrated that the neural network is effective in inspecting the water turbidity level. The best neurone structure is revealed when two hidden layers with 20 and 10 neurones in the first and the second layer, respectively, are used. The training result shows 9.7147 x 10(-7) forMSE, 0.1432 for SSE and 0.99911 for regression. For the testing part, the result for the neurone structure is 8.1473 x 10(-5) for MSE, 0.7509 for SSE and 0.98525 for regression. The results revealed that the performance of ANN demonstrated a good prediction capability when the turbidity level changed. Thus, an optical tomography system with ANN proved to be an efficient tool to classify the water quality level and is beneficial to the water industry.

"This investigation explores the relationship between verbal and non-verbal communication and coexistence in school settings among 30 fourth grade students between the ages of 8 and 11 from a district school. The data collection methods used were the participant observation and the semi-structured interview. After analyzing the information recorded, it is shown that students identify the characteristics of verbal and non-verbal communication and link them to their social behavior at school; thus, the article acknowledges the importance of communication and coexistence habits learned at home and which, together with those acquired at school, become patterns that guide their behavior. This favors the understanding of coexistence processes in schools.

"The anterior temporal lobes (ATLs) have been consistently associated with semantic processing which, in turn, has a key role in reading aloud single words. This study aimed to investigate (1) the reading abilities in patients with the semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), and (2) the relationship between gray matter (GM) volume of the left ATL and word reading performance using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Three groups of participants (svPPA, Alzheimer's Disease, AD and healthy elderly adults) performed a reading task with exception words, regular words and pseudowords, along with a structural magnetic resonance imaging scan. For exception words, the svPPA group had a lower accuracy and a greater number of regularization errors as compared to the control groups of healthy participants and AD patients. Similarly, for regular words, svPPA patients had a lower accuracy in comparison with AD patients, and a greater number of errors related to complex orthography-to-phonology mappings (OPM) in comparison to both control groups. VBM analyses revealed that GM volume of the left ATL was associated with the number of regularization errors. Also, GM volume of the left lateral ATL was associated with the number of errors with complex OPM during regular word reading. Our results suggest that the left ATL might play a role in the reading of exception words, in accordance with its role in semantic processing. Results further support the involvement of the left lateral ATL in combinatorial processes, including the integration of semantic and phonological information, for both exception and regular words.

"This research studies the Emptying-box problem with a porous baffle just behind the entrance opening. A theoretical model is extended to include the effect of a porous baffle, and the theoretical model taking account of porosity establishes the connections between two typical unidirectional displacement flow types. The salt-bath technique is employed to conduct the experiments using an acrylic reduced-scale model. Dye attenuation technique is used to analyze the light intensity data derived from the recorded images of experiments. According to the baffle porosity percentage (phi), the experiments are categorized into two series, EM(79%) and EM(60%). Each series respectively includes three different opening area ratios, which are 1, 0.5 and 0.33. Experimental results show that emptying processes for the cases with a baffle of the larger porosity percentage consist of emptying the dense layer and emptying the mixed layer, but there is only one process of emptying the dense layer for the cases with a baffle of the smaller porosity percentage. Experimental results are in reasonable agreement with the extended theoretical model developed in this research. Two extreme cases, those with and without an impenetrable baffle, are included in this paper to represent two typical flow types of the horizontal inflow denoted as EM(H), as that with phi = 0%, and the vertical inflow denoted as EM(V), as that with phi = 100%, i.e. the unidirectional classical displacement flow and the displacement flow with interfacial mixing. As the porosity percentage increases, the emptying time for the dense layer decreases, but the emptying time for the whole box tends to increase. The emptying time for the dense layer decreases, when the total effective opening area or the reduced gravity increases for the cases having the same porosity percentage. The initial interfacial height of the mixed layer increases, as the baffle porosity percentage increases for the cases having the fixed total effective opening area, or the total effective opening area increases for the cases with the same baffle porosity percentage. The initial buoyancy of the mixed layer is dependent on the penetrative entrainment flow rate from the dense layer to the mixed layer and the emptying time for the dense layer. As the total effective opening area or the porosity percentage increases, experimental results show that the initial buoyancy of the mixed layer tends to increase, and the penetrative entrainment flow rate increases as well, but the emptying time for the dense layer decreases.

"Rare earth ions (REIs) are playing very important roles in modern industries. However, the huge amount of smelting water containing various types of REIs was difficult to separate, which often lead to difficulty in recovery of REIs and water pollution in environment. Selective adsorption was an effective route to recover the REIs in smelting water. Two adsorbents (SiO2-BT, SiO2-BWT) were prepared by grafting plant tannins (Bayberry tannin, Black wattle tannin) onto aminated silica. The as-prepared adsorbents have exhibited a high adsorption capacity to four typical REIs and high selectivity to La3+ among these four REIs (La3+, Ce3+, Pr3+, Nd3+). Furthermore, the after-used adsorbents can be easily regenerated by 0.1mol/L HNO3 solution indicating superior reusability.

"Past research has demonstrated that perceivers spontaneously infer individuals' goals, beliefs, and traits from their behaviors. These inferences processes are essential for predicting others' future behaviors and, thus, for smooth social interaction. Given that social roles (e.g., professor, mother) are also predictive of an individual's future behaviors, we proposed that perceivers spontaneously infer individuals' social roles from their behaviors. Across three experiments, including two different paradigms, we documented that perceivers formed spontaneous role inferences (SRIs) from single behaviors. SRIs occurred unintentionally, efficiently, and had important downstream consequences for impression formation. Namely, SRIs led perceivers to rate targets as higher on role-consistent traits. Together, these findings provide the first empirical demonstration of a novel process in impression formation. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In this article, the MSE method is suggested and executed to construct closed form wave solutions of the above-mentioned equations involving parameters. When the parameters receive special values, impressive solitary wave solutions are derived from the exact solutions.

"Recent research has demonstrated impairments in social cognition associated with multiple sclerosis (MS). The present work asks whether these impairments are associated with atypical moral judgment. Specifically, we assessed whether MS patients are able to integrate information about intentions and outcomes for moral judgment (i.e., appropriateness and punishment judgments) in the case of third-party acts. We found a complex pattern of moral judgments in MS patients: although their moral judgments were comparable to controls' for specific types of acts (e.g., accidental or intentional harms), they nevertheless judged behaviors to be less appropriate and endorsed more severe punishment across the board, and they were also more likely to report that others' responses would be congruent with theirs. Further analyses suggested that elevated levels of externally oriented cognition in MS (due to co-occurring alexithymia) explain these effects. Additionally, we found that the distinction between appropriateness and punishment judgments, whereby harmful outcomes influence punishment judgments to a greater extent than appropriateness judgments, was preserved in MS despite the observed disruptions in the affective and motivational components of empathy. The current results inform the two-process model for intent-based moral judgments as well as possible strategies for improving the quality of life in MS patients.

"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease, and multiple inflammatory cytokines are involved in RA pathogenesis. Interleukin (IL)-18, in particular, has a significant positive correlation with RA. In this study, we investigated the effect of erythroid differentiation regulator 1 (Erdr1), which is negatively regulated by IL-18, in an animal model of inflammatory arthritis, collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in DBA/1J mice. Treatment of mice with recombinant (r) Erdr1 significantly suppressed the severity of arthritis, histologic features of arthritic tissue, and serum levels of anti-collagen autoantibodies (IgG, IgG1, IgG2a and IgM) in CIA. In addition, IL-18 expression was reduced in the affected synovium of rErdr1-treated mice. Interestingly, Erdr1 treatment suppressed migration in contrast to the pro-migratory effect of IL-18, indicating the therapeutic effects of Erdr1 on CIA through inhibiting synovial fibroblast migration. In addition, Erdr1 inhibited activation of ERK1/2, a key signaling pathway in migration of various cell types. Taken together, these data show that rErdr1 exerts therapeutic effects on RA by inhibiting synovial fibroblast migration, suggesting that rErdr1 treatment might be an effective therapeutic approach for RA.

"We investigated the role of Smad4, a signaling molecule of the TGF-beta pathway, in T cells on the pathology of Sjogren's syndrome (SS) in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, an animal model of SS. T cell-specific Smad4-deleted (Smad4(fl/fl,CD4-Cre); Smad4 tKO) NOD mice had accelerated development of SS compared with wildtype (Smad4(+/+,CD4-Cre); WT) NOD mice, including increased lymphocyte infiltration into exocrine glands, decreased tear and saliva production, and increased levels of autoantibodies at 12 weeks of age. Activated/memory T cells and cytokine (IFN-Y, IL-17)- producing T cells were increased in Smad4 tKO NOD mice, however the proportion and function of regulatory T (Treg) cells were not different between Smad4 tKO and WT NOD mice. Effector T (Teff) cells from Smad4 tKO NOD mice were less sensitive than WT Teff cells to suppression by Treg cells. Th17 differentiation capability of Teff cells was similar between Smad4 tKO and WT NOD mice, but IL-17 expression was increased under inducible Treg skewing conditions in T cells from Smad4 tKO NOD mice. Our results demonstrate that disruption of the Smad4 pathway in T cells of NOD mice increases Teff cell activation resulting in upregulation of Th17 cells, indicating that Smad4 in T cells has a protective role in the development of SS in NOD mice.

"This paper presents a low power, compact, and low-complexity pulse-width modulation-based interface circuit for capacitive MEMS sensors. The circuit is designed using a ring oscillator, an RC controlled pulse generator with high-pass filter, and a self-tuning inverter comparator to produce pulse width, which is proportional to differential capacitance and independent of parasitic capacitance. The high-pass filter is utilized to reduce the bandwidth of noise sources. The circuit provides control over sensitivity, dynamic range, and nominal point for the capacitance measurement by selecting controlling parameters, such as resistance of the RC pulse generator, biasing voltage of the self-tuning inverter comparator, and a reference capacitor using digital control signals. The circuit provides high linearity with higher sensitivity and lower power consumption. The sensitivity of the circuit is 0.56 to 3.62 mu s/pF depending on the controlling parameters. The maximum dynamic sensing range is 22 to 270 pF depending on the controlling parameters. The interface circuit is designed and fabricated using the United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) 0.18-mu m CMOS technology. It occupies an active area of 0.17 mm(2) and consumes 98 mu W. A capacitive MEMS-based pressure sensor is also connected with the interface circuit to measure pressure throughout the digestive tract. The sensitivity for pressure from 101 to 200 kPa is 60 ns/kPa and from 50 to 101 kPa is 23 ns/kPa.

"Harvesting rainwater is a common practice worldwide, particularly in areas with no access to a public water supply or insufficient groundwater reserves. More than two million people living in semiarid regions of Brazil consume rainwater stored in cisterns, and little information is available regarding the water quality. Despite the initial good quality of the rainwater, its harvest and storage can introduce contaminants that must be eliminated before consumption. To evaluate the influence of handling, cistern age and precipitation on the quality of harvested rainwater, we monitored seven cisterns in the semiarid Brazilian Northeast over 4 years. Microbial and physicochemical parameters were monitored once a month, and denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was performed at the end of the monitoring period. Coliform bacteria were detected in 100% of samples, while Escherichia coli were observed in 73.8%. The alkalinity and conductivity were the highest for the recently built cisterns due to the dissolution of construction materials. The DGGE of the 16S r DNA did not reveal the presence of E. coli. Instead, DGGE bands sequencing indicated that species primarily affiliated with Alphaproteobacteria were present in all cisterns, indicating the presence of microbial ecosystems capable of purifying and stabilizing the stored rainwater.

"Biofouling is a pervasive challenge in industrial and medical settings with enormous economic and health impacts. Use of quorum-quenching phages is a potential solution in either combating the biofilm or inhibiting biofilm formation when an engineered phage is designed for a specific bacterial system. In the event of a real-life application of synthetic phage, it is necessary to consider the effect of environmental conditions on the synthetic phage. This study focused on both (1) stability of phage lysate under different types of carbon sources and (2) competition of the engineered phage in comparison to a wild-type (wt) phage. Optimal results were found (in plaque forming units [PFUs]) with glucose as a carbon source and were kept stable for almost 30 days. Results suggested that competition happens before 4h. After that time, polymerase chain reaction results from PFU samples showed an increase in T7aiiA, which indicates that these conditions favored the phage replication of the engineered phage over the wt at 27h in a monoculture system. When both stability and competition were combined, the mix of phages showed a trend similar to T7aiiA only primarily after 8 days.

A non destructive measurement technique is developed to detect subsurface photoluminescence defects of fused silica. The fused silica samples polished by different vendors are applied to characterization of subsurface defects and measurement of damage performance. Subsurface photoluminescence defects of fused silica are evaluated by confocal fluorescence microscopy system. Laser induced damage threshold and damage density are measured by 355 nm nanosecond pulse laser. The results show a great differential subsurface quality of fused silica samples. Laser induced damage performance has a good correlation with subsurface defects. This paper shows a new non destructive measurement technique to detect photoluminescence defects on the subsurface layer of polished fused silica.

Robots need to be capable to learn dynamically and incrementally how to interpret, and thus understand multimodal human behavior, which means behavior analysis can be performed for developmental robotics. On the other hand, behavior analysis can also be performed through developmental robotics, since developmental social robots can offer stimulating opportunities for improving scientific understanding of human behavior, and especially to allow a deeper analysis of the semantics and structure of human behavior.

"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematological cancer, characterized by a reciprocal chromosomal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 [t(9;22)], producing the Bcr-Abl oncogene. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) represent the standard of care for CML patients and exert a dual mode of action: direct oncokinase inhibition and restoration of effector-mediated immune surveillance, which is rendered dysfunctional in CML patients at diagnosis, prior to TKI therapy. TKIs such as imatinib, and more potent second-generation nilotinib and dasatinib induce a high rate of deep molecular response (DMR, BCR-ABL1 <= 0.01%) in CML patients. As a result, the more recent goal of therapy in CML treatment is to induce a durable DMR as a prelude to successful treatment-free remission (TFR), which occurs in approximately half of all CML patients who cease TKI therapy. The lack of overt relapse in such patients has been attributed to immunological control of CML. In this review, we discuss an immunological timeline to successful TFR, focusing on the immunology of CML during TKI treatment; an initial period of immune suppression, limiting antitumor immune effector responses in newly diagnosed CML patients, linked to an expansion of immature myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells and aberrant expression of immune checkpoint signaling pathways, including programmed death-1/programmed death ligand-1. Commencement of TKI treatment is associated with immune system re-activation and restoration of effector-mediated [natural killer (NK) cell and T cell] immune surveillance in CML patients, albeit with differing frequencies in concert with differing levels of molecular response achieved on TKI. DMR is associated with maximal restoration of immune recovery in CML patients on TKI. Current data suggest a net balance between both the effector and suppressor arms of the immune system, at a minimum involving mature, cytotoxic CD56dn NK cells may be important in mediating TFR success. However, a major goal remains in CML to identify the most effective pathways to target to maximize an advantageous immune response and promote TFR success.

"Rainwater is an underutilized water resource that has become more important in recent years; due to severe water logging and water shortage in cities. The evaluation of rainwater harvesting potential is of fundamental importance in planning rainwater harvesting systems and management policies. In this study, we used minute-interval rainfall data and the water mass balance method coupling urban hydrological processes to assess the annual rainwater availability potential (RAP) of different underlying surfaces in the urban areas of Beijing (inside the 5th Ring Road). The estimated total RAP was 154.49 million m(3) in 2013. About 53% of rainwater could be effectively harvested for use, among which the rooftops had the highest harvesting ratio of 70%, and contributed about half of the total RAP. Indirect use of rainwater can be achieved through infiltration facilities, of which concave green land construction and porous brick pavement can increase the amount of rainfall that infiltrates into the soil by 18.89% and 55.69%, respectively. Rainwater harvesting and utilization could serve as a significant water source for the urban areas in Beijing.

"OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical characteristics of cervical spine trauma in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) with those of a control group. METHODS: A total of 124 patients with cervical spine trauma from January 2004 to December 2013 were reviewed. Fourteen patients were diagnosed with AS and 25 patients were diagnosed with OPLL; 85 patients were controls. C-spine plain radiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging were obtained for evaluation of cervical spine trauma. The American Spinal Injury Association impairment scale and Subaxial Cervical Spine Injury Classification were used to evaluate the neurologic status of patients and the fracture mechanism. RESULTS: Patients with AS or OPLL had more spinal injuries associated with minor trauma than did the control group. All patients with AS had spinal fracture injuries after cervical spine trauma, but patients with OPLL mostly had spinal cord injuries without bony fractures. After cervical spine trauma, delayed diagnosis occurred in 3 patients with AS (21.4%) and 4 patients with OPLL (15.6%). Improvement from neurologic deficit after treatment showed better outcomes in patients with AS and OPLL than in controls (P = 0.106). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AS or OPLL who had cervical spine trauma showed different characteristics and outcomes than control patients. Proper surgical treatment led to better outcomes in both patients with AS and patients with OPLL than in control patients. Moreover, it is important to thoroughly examine patients with AS or OPLL after cervical trauma so as not to delay diagnosis.

"This paper presents an effective way to enhance the secret key guessing ratio in machine learning based power analysis attack on secure systems such as smartcards. The power supply current traces are obtained by varying the atmospheric temperature for all possible values of key. The collected power supply current traces are then pre-processed by using wavelet transform, data normalization and principal component analysis (PCA) and the featured data samples are used to train the probabilistic neural network (PNN). The network is then tested with a current trace obtained from the device under attack and the correct key is identified. The proposed method achieves 100% success rate in guessing the secret key of the cryptographic algorithm with minimum number of power traces when compared to the existing methods of machine learning technique.

"The term spondyloarthritis (SpA) is used to describe a group of inflammatory autoimmune diseases, including ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis, with common genetic risk factors and clinical features. SpA is clinically distinct from rheumatoid arthritis and typically affects the spine, sacroiliac joints, entheses, and, less commonly, peripheral joints. Although the pathogenesis of SpA is not fully understood, recent findings have identified the interleukin (IL)-17 pathway as a key mediator of disease pathogenesis. Clinical evidence for the efficacy of IL-17A inhibition by biologic agents was initially shown in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, another autoimmune disease mediated by the IL-17 pathway. Subsequently, similar positive efficacy for inhibition of IL-17A was seen in patients with ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis. Inhibition of IL-17A may also improve cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities often found in patients with SpA because studies have linked these disorders to the IL-17 pathway. In this review, we will examine key preclinical studies that demonstrated the mechanistic role of IL-17A in the development SpA and discuss how these observations were translated into clinical practice.

"Past research has shown that rapport and cooperation between individuals is related to the level of nonverbal synchrony they achieve in their interactions. This study investigates the extent to which staff and clients with mild to borderline intellectual disability achieve interactional synchrony in daily social interactions. Whilst there has been work examining how staff can adapt their verbal communication to help achieve better mutual understanding, there has been an absence of work concerning the responsiveness of staff and clients regarding their nonverbal behavior. Nineteen staff members video-recorded a social interaction with one of their clients in which the client had a need for support. The recordings were analyzed using cross recurrence quantification analysis. In addition, fifteen staff members as well as clients with an intellectual disability completed a questionnaire on the quality of the nineteen video-recorded interactions. Analysis of the nonverbal patterns of interaction showed that the staff-client dyads achieved interactional synchrony, but that this synchrony is not pervasive to all nonverbal behaviors. The client observers appeared to be more sensitive to this synchrony or to value it more highly than the staff raters. Staff observers were sensitive to quantitative measures of talking. The more staff in the interactions talked, the lower the quality rating of the interaction. The more the clients talked, the more positively the staff observers rated the interactions. These findings have implications for how collaborative relationships between clients and support workers should be understood.

"The temperature recovering curve derived by cold stimulation experiment reveals human inner metabolism status. The changes of the curve involve many heat-influence factors in which metabolic heat-production is the most important. This paper adopts Tikhonove regularization method to eliminate the measured infrared image data errors and constructs a numerical model based on Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to compute two main heat components heat transfer quantity of blood perfusion and heat-production quantity of metabolism. Different component results are obtained in two typical recovering curves. And the metabolic heat-production quantity comparisons between the diabetic and the healthy show that the metabolic function of the healthy are much better than that of the diabetic numerically. This provides a novel method to estimate the human metabolism quantitatively.

"The study of metal bioaccumulation in the gills of European chub (Squalius cephalus) was conducted in September 2009 at the medium-sized rural river Sutla, characterized by agricultural and municipal type of water contamination. The concentration ranges were established for the first time in the soluble, metabolically available fractions of chub gills for 12 metals, which are environmentally extremely relevant and yet only seldom studied, as follows in a decreasing order: K, 225-895 mg L-1; Na, 78-366 mg L-1; Ca, 19-62 mg L-1; Mg, 13-47 mg L-1; Rb, 164-1762 mu g L-1; Sr, 24-81 mu g L-1; Ba, 13-67 mu g L-1; Mo, 1.3-16 mu g L-1; Co, 0.7-2.7 mu g L-1; Li, 0.4-2.2 mu g L-1; Cs, 0.2-1.9 mu g L-1; and V, 0.1-1.8 mu g L-1. The concentrations of Fe (1.6-6.4 mg L-1) and Mn (16-69 mu g L-1) were also determined and were in agreement with previous reports. By application of general linear modelling, the influence of different abiotic (metal exposure level) and biotic parameters (fish sex, age, size and condition) on metal bioaccumulation was tested. It was established that bioaccumulation of many metals in fish depended on various physiological conditions, wherein Ba could be singled out as metal exhibiting the strongest association with one of biotic parameters, being significantly higher in smaller fish. However, it was also undoubtedly demonstrated that the concentrations of three metals can be applied as reliable indicators of metal exposure even in the conditions of low or moderate water contamination, such as observed in the Sutla River, and those were nonessential elements Li and Cs and essential element Fe. The results of our study present an important contribution to maintenance of high ecological status of European freshwaters, through enrichment of knowledge on the bioaccumulation of various metals in gills of European chub as frequently applied bioindicator species in monitoring of water pollution.

"Geosynthetic structures created for channel erosion protection offer environmental friendly benefits and have demonstrably lower construction and lifetime costs than similar hard structures. A geotextile mattress with a sloping curtain (GMSC) offers an alternative countermeasure against channel erosion. In the present study, experiments were conducted to investigate the working mechanism and effectiveness of GMSCs which were installed on movable beds in a rectangular flume. The bathymetry of the plastic sand beds was measured before and after the tests. The results showed that the presence of the GMSC led to sediment deposition and dune formation at both upstream and downstream edges of the GMSC structure. This will prevent bottom erosion near the structure and increase its stability against flow-induced sediment scour, so that the erodible beds will be protected.

"Control of the LCL-type three-phase grid-connected converter is difficult due to high resonance peak of the LCL filter. Active damping is the state-of-the-art solution to this problem, but the damping performance will be affected by the inherent time delay of digital control, especially for high-power low switching frequency applications. Based on a discrete-time stability analysis of an LCL-type converter with capacitor-current-feedback active damping, a simple and effective time delay compensation method, which is based on area equalization concept, is proposed. The method can reduce the negative impact of the computation delay significantly. It has the potential to serve as a general solution to time delay compensation of a digitally controlled PWM converter. The validity of the proposed method is proved by experimental results.

"It is well known that the existence of unstable zero dynamics is recognized as a major barrier in many control systems. When the usual digital control with zero-order hold (ZOH) or fractional-order hold (FROH) input is used, unstable zero dynamics inevitably appear in the discrete-time model even though the continuous-time system with relative degree more than two is of minimum phase. This paper investigates the zero dynamics, as the sampling period tends to zero, of sampled-data models composed of a generalized sample hold function (GSHF), a continuous-time nonlinear plant and a sampler in cascade. More precisely, we show how an approximate sampled-data model can be obtained for nonlinear systems with two special GSHF cases such that sampled zero dynamics of the resulting model can be arbitrarily placed. Further, two GSHFs with appropriate parameters provide nonlinear zero dynamics as stable as possible, or with improved stability properties even when unstable, for a given continuous-time plant. It is also shown that the intersample behavior arising from the multirate input can be localised by appropriately selecting the design parameters based on the stability condition of the zero dynamics. The results presented here generalize well-known ideas from the linear to nonlinear cases.

The cell-material interaction is assessed through the use of mouse embryotic fibroblast cells (MEF cells) on films, and the results illustrate that the alginate/SPI hydrogel films support cell attachment, spreading, and proliferation.

"Background and aim: Learning about changes in communication of Deaf with dementia (DWD) is important in order to improve services and support DWD and their families. We explored family members' views on the changes in communication DWD have and the ways communication was adapted due to progression of dementia. Methods: A qualitative content analysis of thematic interviews that were conducted with eight close family members of DWD. Results: With decreasing vocabulary and increasing sign-finding difficulties, conversations became poorer, and DWD tended to diverge from the topic. Nonverbal communication became more important as the verbal communication abilities of DWD deteriorated, and the adult children took a more active role by taking initiative and guiding conversations. Conclusion: DWD seem to go through similar changes in communication as hearing people with dementia. Adult children of DWD need to get used to interpreting and assisting their parent's communication through different phases of dementia.

"A fission reactor utilizing low-enriched uranium cermet fuel and supercritical carbon dioxide as coolant was designed to provide electrical power for a manned Mars base. The reactor was designed to generate 1.67 MWth for a fifteen year operational lifetime, with an electric output of 333 kWe. The core has alternating rows of fuel elements and a breeder blanket, with nineteen coolant channels in the fuel element and a single coolant channel in the breeder blanket. The design uses 15% isotopic enriched U-235 based cermet fuel, and uranium dioxide fuelled blankets. S-CO2 is used as a coolant, which converts the heat generated by the reactor to electricity using a closed Brayton cycle. Cermet fuel is used in the form of hexagonal shaped elements with 19 coolant channels and a zirconium hydride neutron moderator. The reactor uses B4C based control drums for control and safety. ZrC is used as thermal insulator, and ensures that the ZrH moderator does not reach an unacceptably high temperature. The coolant channels have a cladding of tungsten to prevent the release of fission gas from the fuel into the coolant. Beryllium reflectors are used to moderate and reflect neutrons back into the active core. The active core has a bull's eye configuration, in which there are alternate fuel and blanket circular rows. Nuclear reactor modeling, neutronics, and depletion analysis were done using MCNP6. The neutronics analysis found the maximum peaking factor that would occur in the core. This was used to determine the greatest amount of thermal power that the core's fuel elements and breeder blanket would experience. This provided the basis for the thermal hydraulics, which sought to determine the maximum inlet and outlet temperatures of the S-CO2 that could be obtained while also keeping all of the reactor materials within an acceptable temperature range. Maximizing these temperatures would provide the highest performance for a power conversion system. Finding the coolant conditions that kept this section of the core below the maximum permissible temperature would ensure that the rest of the core would also remain within an acceptable temperature limit. Simulations were conducted at the different power levels the fuel element and breeder blanket would generate throughout the reactor's fifteen-year lifecycle. The thermal hydraulics which was done using COMSOL Multiphysics. This research presents a very viable reactor design that uses materials currently tested on other types of reactors.

"A growing body of research suggests that social contextual factors such as desires and goals, affective states and stereotypes can shape early perceptual processes. We suggest that a generative Bayesian approach towards perception provides a powerful theoretical framework to accommodate how such high-level social factors can influence low-level perceptual processes in their earliest stages. We review experimental findings that show how social factors shape the perception and evaluation of people, behaviour, and socially relevant objects or information. Subsequently, we summarize the generative view of perception within the `Bayesian brain', and show how such a framework can account for the pervasive effects of top-down social knowledge on social cognition. Finally, we sketch the theoretical and experimental implications of social predictive perception, indicating new directions for research on the effects and neurocognitive underpinnings of social cognition.(C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"An array of pharmacological and environmental factors influence the development and maintenance of tobacco addiction. The nature of these influences likely changes across the course of an extended smoking history, during which time drug seeking can become involuntary and uncontrolled. The present study used an animal model to examine the factors that drive nicotine-seeking behavior after either brief (10days) or extended (40days) self-administration training. In Experiment 1, extended training increased rats' sensitivity to nicotine, indicated by a leftward shift in the dose-response curve, and their motivation to work for nicotine, indicated by an increase in the break point achieved under a progressive ratio schedule. In Experiment 2, extended training imbued the nicotine-paired cue with the capacity to maintain responding to the same high level as nicotine itself. However, Experiment 3 showed that the mechanisms involved in responding for nicotine or a nicotine-paired cue are dissociable, as treatment with the partial nicotine receptor agonist, varenicline, suppressed responding for nicotine but potentiated responding for the nicotine-paired cue. Hence, across extended nicotine self-administration, pharmacological and environmental influences over nicotine seeking increase such that nicotine seeking is controlled by multiple sources, and therefore highly resistant to change.

"A steam gasification processes is an energy conversion pathway through which organic materials are converted to useful energy. In spite of the high energy content in organic waste materials, they have been mostly disposed of in landfills, which causes harmful environmental issues such as methane emissions and ground water pollution and contaminations. In this sense, organic solid waste materials are regarded as alternative resources for conversion to useful energy in the steam gasification process. In this study, three types of waste materials - municipal solid waste (MSW), used tires and sewage sludge - were used to generate syngas through the gasification process in a 1000 degrees C steam atmosphere. The syngas generation rates and its chemical compositions were measured and evaluated over time to determine the characteristics and dynamics of the gasification process. Also, carbon conversion, and mass and energy balances are presented which demonstrates the feasibility of steam gasification as a waste conversion pathway. The results show that the syngas contains high concentrations of H-2, around 41-55% by volume. The syngas generation rate was found to depend on the carbon content in the feedstock regardless of the types of input materials. Comparing to the hydrogen production from water splitting that requires extremely high temperatures at around 1500 degrees C, hydrogen production by steam gasification of organic materials can be regarded as equally effective but requires lower system temperatures.

"Scarcity of water, pollution load, political issues and rising population have drawn great attention for proper management of water resources such as groundwater in the 21st century. The evaluation of groundwater quality is a critical element in the assessment of water resources. The quality/potability of water that is consumed defines the baseline of protection against many diseases and infections. The present study aims to calculate the water quality index (WQI) by the analysis of seven physicochemical parameters according to the National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) to assess the suitability of water for drinking, irrigation purposes and other human uses. In the present investigation, ten groundwater samples were collected from various parts of Seraidi municipality area located in the north-east of Algeria, Physico-chemical parameters such as pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, phosphates, nitrates, turbidity and fecal coliforms were analyzed. The overall WQI values for all the samples were found to be in the range of 68-86, which reveals the fact that the quality of all the samples is only medium to good and could be used for drinking and other domestic uses only after proper treatment.

"The development of a new material designed to trap heavy metals from sediments or wastewater, based on a polypropylene non-woven covalently grafted with cysteine, has been reported in a previous paper (Part A). The non-woven was first functionalized with acrylic acid (AA) which is used as spacer, and then cysteine was immobilized on the substrate through covalent coupling in order to obtain the so-called PP-g-AA-cysteine. Some preliminary heavy metals adsorption tests gave interesting results: at 20 degrees C for 24 h and in a 1000 mg/L heavy metals solution, PP-g-AA-cysteine adsorbs 95 mg Cu/g PP (CuSO4 solution), 104 mg Cu/g PP (Cu(NO3)(2) solution), 135 mg Pb/g PP (Pb(NO3)(2) solution) and 21 mg Cr/g PP (Cr(NO3)(3) solution). In this second part of the work, heavy metals sorption tests were carried out with Cu (II), Pb (II), and Cr (III) separately, in order to determine the sorption capacity of this new sorbent as a function of (i) the heavy metals concentration in the solution, (ii) the contact time with the solution, (iii) the pH and (iv) the ionic strength of the solution containing heavy metals. Moreover, the sorption capacity of PP-g-AA-Cysteine was studied using a polluted solution consisting of a mixture of these different heavy metals. An Electron Paramagnetic Resonance study was finally carried out in order to determine the coordination geometry in the environment of the copper trapped by the PP-g-AA-cysteine.

"This study proposes a new time-domain fault location method based on the impulse response (image) of a power system. The proposed algorithm captures an electrical image of the power system in normal operation by injecting a train of impulses. Following fault detection, an updated electrical image is acquired and compared with the normal operating image. The comparison between both images, in time domain, permits the estimation of the distance to the fault. The performance of the proposed method has been evaluated in a 20 kV distribution system modelled in power systems computer-aided design/electro-magnetic transient design and control (PSCAD/EMTDC). Moreover, laboratory and field tests in a 15 kV overhead line have been carried out to verify and validate model accuracy and performance. Results show a considerable improvement in the accuracy of fault distance estimation compared with existing algorithms. A relevant advantage of the proposed method is its high immunity to ground resistivity, fault resistance and fault type and location in the distribution system.

"Currently, in many European countries public protests, opinion polls, election forecasts and election results create concerns regarding a radicalization of the political culture. Again and again, it seems as if patterns of arguments appear which are particularly directed against one religion - Islam. This paper examines the question whether in Europe a general tendency of skepticism and defense towards Islam and its members is predominant and what reasons for such an attitude in populations might be. Considering socio-psychological approaches to determine the mechanisms for the development of islamophobic attitudes a comparative picture of the situation is drawn. The results reveal that primarily a wide existing feeling of threat to the own identity leads to a fear of many citizens against Islam and Muslims. An essential role for this similarity and levelling are para-social-contacts via media. The result is an increased conflict potential in societies, which in the medium term can lead to a significant threat to social cohesion as well as to a radicalization of political opinions.

"The security of quantum key distribution (QKD) relies on the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, with which legitimate users are able to estimate information leakage by monitoring the disturbance of the transmitted quantum signals. Normally, the disturbance is reflected as bit flip errors in the sifted key; thus, privacy amplification, which removes any leaked information from the key, generally depends on the bit error rate. Recently, a round-robin differential-phase-shiftQKDprotocol for which privacy amplification does not rely on the bit error rate (Sasaki et al 2014 Nature 509 475) was proposed. The amount of leaked information can be bounded by the sender during the state-preparation stage and hence, is independent of the behavior of the unreliable quantum channel. In our work, we apply the tagging technique to the protocol and present a tight bound on the key rate and employ a decoy-state method. The effects of background noise and misalignment are taken into account under practical conditions. Our simulation results show that the protocol can tolerate channel error rates close to 50% within a typical experiment setting. That is, there is a negligible restriction on the error rate in practice.

"This paper describes the second part of a series of investigation to develop algorithms for simultaneous retrieval of aerosol parameters and surface reflectance from the future hyperspectral and geostationary satellite sensors such as Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO). The information content in these hyperspectral measurements is analyzed for 6 principal components (PCs) of surface spectra and a total of 14 aerosol parameters that describe the columnar aerosol volume V-total fine-mode aerosol volume fraction, and the size distribution and wavelength-dependent index of refraction in both coarse and fine mode aerosols. Forward simulations of atmospheric radiative transfer are conducted for 5 surface types (green vegetation, bare soil, rangeland, concrete and mixed surface case) and a wide range of aerosol mixtures. It is shown that the PCs of surface spectra in the atmospheric window channel could be derived from the top-of-the-atmosphere reflectance in the conditions of low aerosol optical depth (AOD <= 0.2 at 550 nm), with a relative error of 1%. With degree freedom for signal analysis and the sequential forward selection method, the common bands for different aerosol mixture types and surface types can be selected for aerosol retrieval. The first 20% of our selected bands accounts for more than 90% of information content for aerosols, and only 4 PCs are needed to reconstruct surface reflectance. However, the information content in these common bands from each TEMPO individual observation is insufficient for the simultaneous retrieval of surface's PC weight coefficients and multiple aerosol parameters (other than V-total). In contrast, with multiple observations for the same location from TEMPO in multiple consecutive days, 1-3 additional aerosol parameters could be retrieved. Consequently, a self adjustable aerosol retrieval algorithm to account for surface types, AOD conditions, and multiple-consecutive observations is recommended to derive aerosol parameters and surface reflectance simultaneously from TEMPO. 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The gain of PGA in the AGC loop ranges from 0dB to 40dB in 2dB step with gain error not more than 0.2dB. The integrated noise in the audio range (20 Hz similar to 20 kHz) is 2.28 mu VRMS when the gain is set at 40dB. The total harmonic distortion (THD) is below -70dB over the audio frequencies at 0.4-Vpp differential output.

"Research linking religion to prejudice suggests that highly religious individuals, and religious fundamentalists specifically, may be especially susceptible to expressing prejudice toward dissimilar others, whereas people who are less religious and fundamentalist do not show the same effect. The selective prejudice hypothesis predicts that this pattern of results occurs because the cognitive and motivational styles or particular values associated with fundamentalism exacerbate prejudice. In 3 studies, using 4 data sets (N = 6,047), we test this selective prejudice hypothesis against the religious values conflict hypothesis, which predicts that both people with high and low levels of fundamentalism will be prejudiced toward those with dissimilar beliefs to protect the validity and vitality of people's belief systems. Consistent with the religious values conflict hypothesis, we found that people both high and low in fundamentalism were prejudiced toward dissimilar others (Study 1) and these differences were primarily due to differences in the content of religious belief rather than the style of belief (Study 2). In Study 3, we expanded these findings to additional measures of prejudice, found that multiple measures of threat were potential mediators, and explored the possibility of an integrative perspective. In total, these results suggest that people with both relatively high and low levels of fundamentalism are susceptible to prejudice and in some cases the size of this religious intergroup bias may be higher among people with high levels of fundamentalism.

"DNA methylation is traditionally thought to be established during early development and to remain mostly unchanged thereafter in healthy tissues, although recent studies have shown that this epigenetic mark can be more dynamic. Epigenetic changes occur in the liver after birth, but the timing and underlying biological processes leading to DNA methylation changes are not well understood. We hypothesized that this epigenetic reprogramming was the result of terminal differentiation of hepatocyte precursors. Using genomic approaches, we characterized the DNA methylation patterns in mouse liver from E18.5 until adulthood to determine if the timing of the DNA methylation change overlaps with hepatocyte terminal differentiation, and to examine the genomic context of these changes and identify the regulatory elements involved. Out of 271,325 CpGs analyzed throughout the genome, 214,709 CpGs changed DNA methylation by more than 5% (e.g., from 5 to 10% methylation) between E18.5 and 9 wk of age, and 18,863 CpGs changed DNA methylation by more than 30%. Genome-scale data from six time points between E18.5 and P20 show that DNA methylation changes coincided with the terminal differentiation of hepatoblasts into hepatocytes. We also showed that epigenetic reprogramming occurred primarily in intergenic enhancer regions while gene promoters were less affected. Our data suggest that normal postnatal hepatic development and maturation involves extensive epigenetic remodeling of the genome, and that enhancers play a key role in controlling the transition from hepatoblasts to fully differentiated hepatocytes. Our study provides a solid foundation to support future research aimed at further revealing the role of epigenetics in stem cell biology.

Macular examination was performed using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) before and at 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 36 weeks after surgery. If both eyes in one patient underwent cataract surgery, one eye was randomly selected. Odds ratios and confidence intervals were estimated. Out of 240 patients enrolled in this series, 65 patients (27.1 %) showed positive allergic status, 19 patients (7.9 %) suffered from atopic syndromes, and 11 (4.6 %) showed both (allergies and atopic diseases). PCME occurred in eight patients (12.3 %) of the allergy cohort, whereas no patient (0 %) of the atopy cohort developed PCME. The risk of PCME was comparable in patients with allergies or atopic diseases to patients without allergies or atopy (allergy: p = 0.635; odds ratio (OR) 1.303, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.461-3.398; atopy: p = 0.234; OR 0.000, 95 % CI 0-1.815). Positive status of allergy or atopy does not seem to increase the risk of PCME. Therefore, postoperative treatment after cataract surgery does not have to be modified in allergic or atopic patients.

"To date, to the best of the authors' knowledge, in almost all of the studies performed around the hemodynamics of bileaflet mechanical heart valves, a heart rate of 70-72beats/min has been considered. In fact, the heart rate of similar to 72beats/min does not represent the entire normal physiological conditions under which the aortic or prosthetic valves function. The heart rates of 120 or 50beats/min may lead to hemodynamic complications, such as plaque formation and/or thromboembolism in patients. In this study, the hemodynamic performance of the bileaflet mechanical heart valves in a wide range of normal and physiological heart rates, that is, 60-150beats/min, was studied in the opening phase. The model considered in this study was a St. Jude Medical bileaflet mechanical heart valve with the inner diameter of 27mm in the aortic position. The hemodynamics of the native valve and the St. Jude Medical valve were studied in a variety of heart rates in the opening phase and the results were carefully compared. The results indicate that peak values of the velocity profile downstream of the valve increase as heart rate increases, as well as the location of the maximum velocity changes with heart rate in the St. Jude Medical valve model. Also, the maximum values of shear stress and wall shear stresses downstream of the valve are proportional to heart rate in both models. Interestingly, the maximum shear stress and wall shear stress values in both models are in the same range when heart rate is90beats/min (up to similar to 40% growth compared to that of the native valve). The findings of this study may be of importance in the hemodynamic performance of bileaflet mechanical heart valves. They may also play an important role in design improvement of conventional prosthetic heart valves and the design of the next generation of prosthetic valves, such as percutaneous valves.

"DNA vaccine is a third generation vaccine type based on concepts and techniques of molecular biology. It can closely mimic live infections and induce both antibody and cell mediated immune responses and thus has much potential for treating chronic viral infection and cancer. How do we transport the DNA vaccine to the right target cells in lymphoid tissues and organs? How do we achieve high and robust gene transfection efficiency while simultaneously inducing DC maturation and antigen presentation? These questions pose significant challenges and addressing them may require serious efforts in developing better biomaterials as carriers. This review is dedicated to the discussion of polymers as nanoscale carriers for the DNA vaccine. We summarize recent advances in polymer science and engineering to overcome multilevel hurdles for DNA vaccine delivery and conclude with thoughts on challenges and opportunities that may shape the future of polymers in DNA vaccination.

"Few studies in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have profiled disease-specific features of the condition in conjunction with assessment of caregivers' burden, distress, quality of life, and investigated patient survival. Eighty-four ALS patients and their primary caregivers were enrolled. Patients completed ALS-specific measures of physical and cognitive function, while caregivers completed measures of anxiety, depression, caregiver burden, and quality of life. Patient-caregiver dyads were interviewed about their health-service utilisation. Survival data were obtained through the Irish register for ALS. Participants were dichotomised into low/high groups according to the severity of self-reported caregiver burden, based on statistically derived cut-off scores. High-burdened caregivers (n = 43) did not significantly differ from low-burdened caregivers (n = 41) with respect to disease-specific characteristics, i.e., ALSFRS-R, bulbar- or spinal-onset ALS, disease duration, or survival data. However, significant differences were reported on subjective measures of anxiety (p < 0.000), depression (p < 0.001), distress (p < 0.000), and quality of life (p < 0.000). These data demonstrate the limited impact of ALS patient-related variables, i.e., ALSFRS-R and onset, on caregiver burden in ALS, and identify the importance of the psychological composition of caregivers. This study suggests that the subjective experience of individual caregivers is an important factor influencing the severity of experienced caregiver burden.

"This paper proposes a novel unsupervised feature learning algorithm for land-use scene recognition on very high resolution remote sensing imagery. The proposed technique utilizes a multipath sparse coding architecture in order to capture multiple aspects of discriminative structures within complex remote sensing sceneries. Unlike the previous sparse coding and bag-of-visual-words-based techniques that rely on the handcrafted feature descriptors such as scale-invariant feature transform, the proposed technique extracts dense low-level features from the raw data, including the visual (RGB) data and near-infrared (NIR) data, using image patches of varying sizes at different layers. The proposed technique has been evaluated on three data sets, including the 21-category UC Merced land-use RGB data set with a 1-ft spatial resolution, the 9-category ground scene RGB-NIR data set, and the 10-category Singapore land-use RGB-NIR data set with a 0.5-m spatial resolution. The experimental results show that the proposed technique outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

"Low permeability engineered landfill barriers often consist of a combination of geosynthetics and mineral layers. Even though numerical modelling software is applied during the landfill design process, a lack of data about mechanical performance of landfill barriers is available to validate and calibrate those models. Instrumentation has been installed on a landfill site to monitor multilayer landfill lining system physical performance. The lining system comprises of a compacted clay layer overlaid by high density polyethylene geomembrane, geotextile and sand. Data recorded on the site includes: geosynthetic displacements (extensometers), strains (fibre optics, Demec strain gauges, extensometers) and stresses imposed on the liner (pressure cells). In addition, temperature readings were collected by a logger installed at the surface of the geomembrane, at the clay surface using pressure cell thermistors and air temperature using a thermometer. This paper presents readings collected throughout a period of three years and compares this measured performance with the corresponding numerical modelling of the lining system for stages during construction. Numerical modelling predictions of lining system behaviour during construction are comparable with the measurements when the geosynthetics are covered soon after placement, however, where the geosynthetics are left exposed to the sun for an extended period of time, in situ behaviour of the geosynthetics cannot be replicated by the numerical analysis. This study highlights the significant influence of the effect of temperature on geosynthetics displacements. A simple thermal analysis of the exposed geosynthetics is used to support the explanation for observed behaviour. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"Water erosion causes soil degradation and nonpoint pollution. Pollutants are primarily transported on the surfaces of fine soil and sediment particles. Several soil loss models and empirical equations have been developed for the size distribution estimation of the sediment leaving the field, including the physically-based models and empirical equations. Usually, physically-based models require a large amount of data, sometimes exceeding the amount of available data in the modeled area. Conversely, empirical equations do not always predict the sediment composition associated with individual events and may require data that are not always available. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a model to predict the particle size distribution (PSD) of eroded soil. A total of 41 erosion events from 21 soils were used. These data were compiled from previous studies. Correlation and multiple regression analyses were used to identify the main variables controlling sediment PSD. These variables were the particle size distribution in the soil matrix, the antecedent soil moisture condition, soil erodibility, and hillslope geometry. With these variables, an artificial neural network was calibrated using data from 29 events (r(2) = 0.98, 0.97, and 0.86; for sand, silt, and clay in the sediment, respectively) and then validated and tested on 12 events (r(2) = 0.74, 0.85, and 0.75; for sand, silt, and clay in the sediment, respectively). The artificial neural network was compared with three empirical models. The network presented better performance in predicting sediment PSD and differentiating rain-runoff events in the same soil. In addition to the quality of the particle distribution estimates, this model requires a small number of easily obtained variables, providing a convenient routine for predicting PSD in eroded sediment in other pollutant transport models.

"An in vivo metabolism study in humans was carried out to investigate the toxicokinetics and metabolism of sodium selenate differentiating by the trimethyl-selenium (TMSe) status. Therefore, the changes in blood plasma concentration and the urinary excretion within 24 h of seven healthy subjects after oral administration of a dietary supplement containing sodium selenate (50 mu g selenium) were analyzed. Three subjects belong to the subgroup of TMSe eliminators, and four subjects were related to the non-TMSe eliminators subgroup. The concentrations of total selenium in blood plasma and urine samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Additionally, speciation analysis of urine samples was performed using ICP-MS coupled to a liquid chromatography system. Plasma selenium concentration changed from 82.5 +/- 12.5 mu g Se/L before to 85.1 +/- 12.0 mu g Se/L 2-3 h after supplementation. Considering the individual 24-hour background amounts of renal excreted selenium, the ingestion caused an additional excretion of 15.4 +/- 3.3 mu g Se/24 h ((=) over cap 31.1 +/- 7.6 % of the administered dose) with a maximum elimination already 2 h after exposure. The differentiated analysis revealed that in all subjects, the main elimination product (30.1 +/- 6.9 % of the administered dose) was unmetabolized selenate. TMSe was only detected in the urine of the TMSe eliminators. This subgroup excreted in comparison with the non-TMSe eliminators a significantly lower amount of selenate. Only one subject metabolized selenate to a larger portion to methyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-1-seleno-beta-D-galactopyranoside (SeSug1) and methyl-2-amino-2deoxy-1-seleno-beta-D-galactopyranoside (SeSug3). All other subjects showed only a minor metabolism of selenate to selenium-containing carbohydrates. By individuals, which do not excrete TMSe in urine basically, selenate is metabolized only marginally and is excreted rapidly via urine generally. In contrast, a considerable portion of this inorganic selenium compound is metabolized by individuals, which eliminate TMSe basically. An elevated metabolism may also be provided by individuals, which eliminate high levels of selenium-containing carbohydrates basically. The difference in metabolism may imply a different disposition for pharmacological or toxic effects by exposure to inorganic selenium compounds.

"Covert channel in network protocols has been an area absorbing great interests for many years in secret transmission. Recently, covert channels based on packet length have become a new preference among researchers in this field because of their excellent performance in simulating statistical features of network packets in real world. However, few approaches which can embed secret information with great security ensured has been worked out by so far. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the traffic stream of UDP packets and several storage features of data files and then propose a novel network steganography scheme based on IP address and UDP packet length in order to overcome the drawbacks of existing schemes. A comprehensive set of corresponding experiment results show that the proposed covert channel follows the normal traffic statistical features well and thus ensures more security than that of the existing algorithms.

"Young adolescents are generally considered to be self-absorbed. Studies indicate that they lack relevant general cognitive abilities, such as impulse control, that mature in early adulthood. However, their idealism may cause them to be more intolerant of unfair treatment to others and thus result in their engaging in more altruistic behavior. The present study aimed to clarify whether young adolescents are more altruistic than adults and thus indicate whether altruistic competence is domain-specific. One hundred 22 young adolescents and adults participated in a face-to-face, two-round, third-party punishment experiment. In each interaction group, a participant served as an allocator who could share money units with a stranger; another participant who knew the allocator could punish the acquaintance for the stranger. Participants reported their emotions after the first round, and at the end of the experiment, the participants justified their behavior in each round. The results indicated that the young adolescents both shared more and punished more than did the adults. Sharing was associated with a reference to fairness in the justifications, but altruistic punishment was associated with subsequent positive emotion. In sum, greater altruism in young adolescents compared to adults with mature cognitive abilities provides evidence of domain-specificity of altruistic competence. Moreover, sharing and altruistic punishment are related to specific cognitive and emotional mechanisms, respectively.

"PurposeEpidemiological studies of asthma in adolescence commonly rely on self-reports. This study aimed to compare adolescent and parent reports regarding the presence of asthma and asthma symptoms in two ethnic groups, Jews and Arabs, living in the same country. MethodsEighth-grade pupils attending five schools in Tel Aviv and four schools in two Arab cities in Israel were asked to complete the self-report International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire in the classroom. Their parents were interviewed by telephone using the parental ISAAC questionnaire. We assessed prevalence rates of asthma and asthma symptoms according to adolescent and parent responses. Agreement between adolescents and parents was assessed by Cohen's kappa coefficient. ResultsAdolescents reported more asthma and asthma symptoms than their parents in both the Jewish (327 adolescent-parent pairs) and the Arab (335 adolescent-parent pairs) groups. Both groups showed moderate adolescent-parent chance-corrected agreement for current asthma (kappa 0.59 in Jews, 0.52 in Arabs, P=0.60) and lifetime asthma (kappa 0.53 Jews, 0.44 in Arabs, P=0.33); and slight to fair chance-corrected agreement for asthma symptoms. There were no statistically significant differences between the Jewish and Arab populations in chance-corrected agreement for any of the parameters assessed. ConclusionsJewish and Arab adolescents more often report asthma and asthma symptoms than do their parents. This seems to be a cross-cultural phenomenon. Therefore, particular attention should be paid to the source of information when comparing prevalence of asthma and asthma symptoms across studies. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2017;52:154-159.

"Aims Genetic polymorphisms may contribute to platelet reactivity in diabetic patients; however, the information on their influence on long-term antiplatelet therapy is lacking. Our aim was to evaluate the role of previously described genetic variants and platelet reactivity on risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events. Methods Blood samples were obtained from 303 Caucasian patients. Genome-wide genotyping was performed using Illumina Human Omni 2.5-Quad microarrays, and individual genotyping of selected SNPs was performed using a custom Sequenom iPLEX assay in conjunction with the Mass ARRAY platform. Platelet reactivity was measured with VerifyNow Aspirin Assay and PFA-100 Assay. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to determine the impact of genetic variants and platelets reactivity on risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events. Results Among the 237 patients included in the follow-up, death from any cause occurred in 34 (14.3%) patients and cardiovascular events occurred in 51 (21.5%) patients within a median observation time of 71 months (5.9 years). In univariate analyses, significant association in the presence of minor alleles in TXBA2R (rs1131882) with primary (HR 2.54, 95% CI 1.15-5.60, p = 0.021) and secondary endpoint (HR 2.06, 95% CI 1.06-4.04, p = 0.034) was observed. In addition, multivariate analyses revealed the impact of this polymorphism on primary (HR 2.34, 95% CI 1.09-5.00, p = 0.029) and secondary endpoint (HR 1.89, 95% CI 1.00-3.57, p = 0.048). Conclusions Results of the study demonstrate for the first time an association between genetic polymorphism within TXBA2R gene encoding platelet's surface receptor and long-term survival of diabetic patients treated with ASA.

"In a context of increasing landscape modifications and climatic changes, scale hierarchy becomes an ever more crucial issue to integrate in the analysis of drivers and stressors of biological communities, especially in river networks. To cope with this issue, we developed (i) spatial hierarchical models of functional diversity of stream invertebrate communities to assess the relative influence of local-vs. regional-scale factors in structuring community assembly, and (ii) analysis of metacommunity elements to determine the ecological processes behind the structuring. The spatial structuring of benthic invertebrate cominunities was investigated over 568 sites in South-eastern France. Community structure was mainly driven by the altitudinal gradient and spring flow variation at broad scales, with functional diversity gradually decreasing with elevation and being maximized at intermediate levels of flow variability. According to the 'elements of metacommunity structure' analysis, the prevailing influence of the altitudinal gradient was also supported by a Clenientsian structuration of invertebrate communities. Conversely, the influence of observed climatic changes in temperature and rainfall was weak and observed only at fine scales. As a result, natural environmental filters were stronger drivers of the functional diversity of communities than human-induced stressors (e.g. water pollution and hydromorphological alterations). More broadly, our results suggest that management needs to embrace the possibilities of gathering high spatial and taxonomical resolution data when analysing and predicting flow variation and climate change effects in order to preserve and restore functionally diverse communities. Moreover, to develop environmental flow schemes or restoration and climate change adaptation strategies for freshwater communities, local and regional processes need to be addressed simultaneously; equally responsible as drivers of community diversity.

"Trust is one of the most challenging issues in the emerging cloud computing era. Over the past few years, numerous cloud service providers have been emerged providing similar kinds of services. It has become incredibly complex for the cloud clients to make a distinction among multiple cloud service providers offering similar kinds of services. Cloud clients need trustworthy service providers who provide services exactly as per the SLA and do not deviate from their promises. Though, there have been significant efforts to form trust between service providers and the clients by providing data, storage and network security, but relatively fewer efforts have been made in the field of trustworthiness determination by monitoring the compliance of offered services as per the SLA. This paper presents the design of a trust evaluation framework that uses the compliance monitoring mechanism to determine the trustworthiness of service providers. The compliance values are computed and then processed using a technique known as the Improved Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (Improved TOPSIS) to obtain trust on the service providers. Case study based approach has been followed to demonstrate the usability and the applicability of the proposed framework. Experiments have been performed using the real cloud data extracted from the Cloud Harmony reports. From the experimental results, it is clear that the proposed framework can be used in real cloud environments to determine the trustworthiness of service providers by employing the real time monitoring of their services.

"In this paper, we focus on Global Self-consistent, Hierarchical, High-resolution Geography (GSHHG) database registration for remote sensing images taken from geostationary meteorological satellites. While the accuracy of feature matching is the key component. To improve it, we propose a neighborhood geometry-based feature matching scheme which includes three steps: neighborhood coding, verification and fitting. (1) Neighborhood coding represents landmarks of GSHHG as a descriptive bit-matrix, and quantifies remote sensing images to a probability-based edge map and a binary geometry-based edge map. As a result, both gradient arid geometry similarity of local features in the remote sensing image and GSHHG can be measured. (2) Neighborhood verification is to encode spatial relationship among local features in neighbor, and discover outliers. (3) Neighborhood fitting fits the shorelines of GSHHG with the landmarks registered by neighborhood verification to improve recall. Experimental results on 25 pairs of newly annotated images show that the proposed method is competitive to several prior arts with respect to matching accuracy. What is more, our method is significantly more efficient than others.

"The importance of computer simulations in the assessment of nuclear plant safety systems has increased dramatically during the last three decades. The systems of interest include existing or proposed systems that operate, for example, normal operation, in design basis accident conditions, and in severe accident scenario beyond the design basis. The role of computer simulations is especially critical if one is interested in the reliability, robustness, or safety of high consequence systems that cannot be physically tested in a fully representative environment. In the European 7th Framework SARNET project, European Commission (EC) co-funded from 2008 to 2013, the Phebus FPT3 experiment was chosen as a code benchmark exercise to assess the status of the various codes used for severe accident analyses in light water reactors. The aim of the benchmark was to assess the capability of computer codes to model in an integral way the physical processes taking place during a severe accident in a pressurised water reactor (PWR), starting from the initial stages of core degradation, fission product, actinide and structural material release, their transport through the primary circuit up to the behaviour of the released fission products in the containment. The FPT3 benchmark was well supported, with participation from 16 organisations in 11 countries, using 8 different codes. The temperature history of the fuel bundle and the total hydrogen production were well captured. No code was able to reproduce accurately the final bundle state, using as bulk fuel relocation temperature, the temperature of the first significant material relocation observed during the experiment. The total volatile fission product release was well simulated, but the kinetics were generally overestimated. Concerning the modelling of semi-volatile, low-volatile and structural material release, the models need improvement, notably for Mo and Ru for which a substantial difference between bundle and fuel release was experimentally observed, due to retention in the cooler upper part of the bundle. The retention in the primary circuit was not well predicted, this was due mainly the non-prototypic formation of a boron-rich blockage in the rising line of the FPT3 steam generator, simulated in the circuit as a single external cooled U tube. The deposition mechanism and the volatility of some elements (Te, Cs, I) could be better predicted. Containment vessel thermal hydraulics, designed in the experiment to be well-mixed, were well calculated. Concerning the containment aerosol depletion rate, only stand-alone cases (in which the input data were derived from experimental data) provided acceptable results, whilst the integral cases (in which the input data came from circuit calculations) tended to largely overestimate the total aerosol airborne mass entering the containment. The disagreement of the calculated total aerosol airborne mass in the containment vessel with the measured one is due to the combination of a general underestimation of the overall circuit retention and overestimation of fission product and structural material release. Calculation of iodine chemistry in the containment turned out to be a major challenge. Its quality strongly depends on the correct prediction of chemistry speciation in the integral codes. The major difficulties are related to the presence of high fraction of iodine in gaseous form in the primary circuit during the test, which is not correctly reproduced by the codes. This inability of the codes compromised simulation of the observed iodine behaviour in the containment. In the benchmark a significant user effect was detected (different results being obtained by different users of the same code) which had to be taken into account in analysing the results. This article reports the benchmark results comparing the main parameters calculated and observed, summarising the results achieved, and identifying the areas in which understanding needs to be improved. Relevant experimental and theoretical work is under way to resolve the issues raised. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"The modern environmental awareness leads to the realisation that the human metabolism is stressed by a huge number of chemical substances. Generally, these background exposures, consisting predominantly from natural and partly from industrial as well as life style sources, are tolerated without any adverse effects. Pesticides are chemicals intentionally introduced to the environment and have become necessities in modern agriculture as well as in indoor pest control. Their residues, therefore, is attracting more and more concern. For the majority of pesticides neither occupational nor environmental medical risk evaluations are so far available. Therefore, at the moment the occupational as well as the environmental supported preventive concept may only be achieved, if binding instructions upon experience and guide values are developed for the assessment of the individual risk of handling pesticides. In the occupational and environmental pesticide prophylaxis the ubiquitous background exposure levels in consideration with individual susceptibility factors should be recommended as provisional biological tolerance guide values. The suitability of this guide values concept for pesticides is demonstrated by determining the background exposure and the biomarkers of susceptibility of 250 unexposed persons as well as of more than 1200 occupationally exposed persons. As a result, a significant dependence of their health fidelity from the background exposure profile impressed on the individual polymorphism of the key enzymes was observed. Especially, the cumulative adducts of electrophilic substances and their metabolites with macromolecules like HSA and Hb turned our to be sensitive markers for the capacity of the individual metabolic rate. For alkylating and arylating pesticides the observed interindividual susceptibility to their adverse effects depends on the variability of the individual 'toxifying' and 'detoxifying' metabolic rates. Until scientific evaluation of official biological tolerance values for pesticides is carried out, it is advisable for risk prophylaxis to orientate the assessment of any individual tolerable stress and strain from pesticides to the synergism between background exposure, life style factors and biomarkers of specific susceptibility. They may be examined by a monitoring of conjugates and polymorphism marked by the individual metabolic rate. The monitoring and surveillance of pesticide exposures is mainly introduced by the recommendation of tolerable biological values from the reference value concept. This concept is an essential contribution to an objective risk discussion with regard to individual stress and strain profiles in environmental exposure scenarios.

"Women, especially in developing countries, are often responsible for managing water at the household level. However, they are rarely represented in bodies that decide on water management, and they hardly play a role in the implementation of projects to increase water access. While the need for enhanced gender equity in water management is acknowledged in the international development discourse, the complexities of implementing it are poorly understood. This article presents a qualitative case study of women participation in the Program 'One Million Cisterns' in the Brazilian Semi-Arid region, to illustrate the promise and the challenges of bringing about women's participation and empowering. The case study shows that women not only derived significant material benefits from the program (access to water), they also acquired roles and responsibilities - as cistern builders and as members of local water commissions - that traditionally had been reserved for men. Key for this transformational process, we argue, was the role played by local feminist NGOs and social movements who helped rural women create new spaces for social inclusion in water development.

"alpha 1-antitrypsin (AAT), a circulating glycoprotein that rises during acute phase responses and healthy pregnancies, exhibits immunomodulatory properties in several T-cell-dependent immune pathologies. However, AAT does not directly interfere with T-cell responses; instead, it facilitates polarization of macrophages and dendritic cells towards M2-like and tolerogenic cells, respectively. AAT also allows NK cell responses against tumor cells, while attenuating DC-dependent induction of autoimmune NK cell activities. Since AAT-treated macrophages bear resemblance to cancer-promoting tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), it became imperative to examine the possible induction of tumor permissive conditions by AAT. Here, AAT treatment is examined for its effect on tumor development, metastatic spread, and tumor immunology. Systemic AAT treatment of mice inoculated with B16-F10 melanoma cells resulted in significant inhibition of tumor growth and metastatic spread. Using NK cell-resistant RMA cells, we show that AAT interferes with tumor development in a CD8(+) T-cell-dependent manner. Unexpectedly, upon analysis of tumor cellular composition, we identified functional tumor-infiltrating CD8(+) T-cells alongside M1-like TAMs in AAT-treated mice. Based on the ability of AAT to undergo chemical modifications, we emulated conditions of elevated reactive nitrogen and oxygen species. Indeed, macrophages were stimulated by treatment with nitrosylated AAT, and IFN gamma transcripts were significantly elevated in tumors extracted soon after ischemia-reperfusion challenge. These context-specific changes may explain the differential effects of AAT on immune responses towards tumor cells versus benign antigenic targets. These data suggest that systemically elevated levels of AAT may accommodate its physiological function in inflammatory resolution, without compromising tumor-targeting immune responses.

"Purpose of reviewDendritic cells are specialized antigen-presenting cells which link innate and adaptive immunity, through recognition and presentation of antigen to T cells. Although the importance of dendritic cells has been demonstrated in many animal models, their contribution to human immunity remains relatively unexplored in vivo.Given their central role in infection, autoimmunity, and malignancy, dendritic cell deficiency or dysfunction would be expected to have clinical consequences.Recent findingsHuman dendritic cell deficiency disorders, related to GATA binding protein 2 (GATA2) and interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) mutations, have highlighted the importance of dendritic cells and monocytes in primary immunodeficiency diseases and begun to shed light on their nonredundant roles in host defense and immune regulation in vivo. The contribution of dendritic cell and monocyte dysfunction to the pathogenesis of primary immunodeficiency disease phenotypes is becoming increasingly apparent. However, dendritic cell analysis is not yet a routine part of primary immunodeficiency disease workup.SummaryWidespread uptake of dendritic cell/monocyte screening in clinical practice will facilitate the discovery of novel dendritic cell and monocyte disorders as well as advancing our understanding of human dendritic cell biology in health and disease.

"New species discoveries or the rediscovery of species once considered extinct or extirpated is good news, and yet prospects for long-term survival may be bleak if remnant populations are small and isolated. Because (re)discovered species are commonly rare or cryptic, data to inform appropriate conservation actions are usually sparse. We demonstrate how to make the most of available data, using the recent rediscovery in Ghana of sitatunga Tragelaphus spekei as an illustrative case study. Sitatunga were thought extinct in Ghana for over 50years, but were rediscovered' by science in Avu Lagoon in 1998. Little is known about this species, especially West African populations, given its cryptic nature and inaccessible wetland habitat. Our approach to maximizing insights given limited data first paired observations of occurrence with landscape characteristics derived from open-access remote sensing data, creating the first ever habitat suitability model for sitatunga. This model then served to: (1) elucidate habitat preferences; (2) assess possible existence and connectivity of remnant populations elsewhere in Ghana; and (3) estimate maximum total and effective population size. Moreover, the timing of occurrence sightings provided insights into behavior. Sitatunga sightings were rare, heavily male-biased and mostly occurred between 6pm and 6am. Suitable habitat was limited, suggesting that habitat in and near Avu Lagoon is insufficient to ensure long-term population viability, and the existence of other, connected populations in Ghana is improbable. Without continued protection, and possibly additional interventions to augment population numbers or gene flow, the sitatunga in Avu Lagoon will likely go extinct. Our case study demonstrates the conservation challenges associated with the rediscovery of relict populations, and the utility of applying tools such as habitat suitability models to sparse data. Moreover, our research stresses the need to implement immediate conservation action upon species (re)discoveries to prevent (regional) extinction.

"We explore the potential for using a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) quadcopter to collect long-dwell imagery of the nearshore from which important measurements can be made at low cost and with flexibility. This paper extends the existing topographic imaging approaches that rely on having plentiful ground control spread across the image, to the nearshore case where the bulk of the image is water with no control point and vehicle metadata must be used. The UAV autopilot was found to be capable of excellent station-keeping with the positional errors of 0.20 and 0.53 m (horizontal and vertical) and the viewing angle errors of 0.25 degrees (tilt and roll) and 0.38 degrees (azimuth). The ground position of imaged objects could be found with 0.21-m accuracy. Metadata returned by the UAV on camera position was accurate at 5 m, and the camera roll could be assumed to be 0 degrees, reducing the ground control requirements to two, or even one location. Even under this extreme simplification, ground position errors averaged only 10 m but were worse for cases when only control points near to the UAV were used. A model for the visual contrast of waves when viewed from different angles found that large tilts are important but, in contrast to theory, that there was little dependence on the viewing azimuthal angle. Derived Argus products agreed well with the same products collected using a traditional fixed Argus station. UAVs appear to be a very promising alternate to fixed camera systems if limited duration sampling is adequate.

"HLA-A is a locus of the major histocompatibility complex situated on chromosome 6p21.3. HLA-A has been shown to be associated with susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we firstly investigated the association of gene variants in HLA-A and brain structures on MRI in a large sample from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to explore the effects of HLA-A on AD pathogenesis. We selected the hippocampus, parahippocampus, posterior cingulate, precuneus, middle temporal, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala as regions of interest (ROIs). In hybrid population analysis, our results showed a marginally significant association between rs9260168 and the atrophy of the left parahippocampus (P = 0.007, Pc = 0.054), rs3823342 and the atrophy of the left parahippocampus (P = 0.014, Pc = 0.054), rs76475517, which only exists in Caucasians with HLA-A23 or HLA-A24 alleles, and the atrophy of the right amygdala (P = 0.010, Pc = 0.085) at baseline. In particular, the haplotype (TGACAAGG), as a surrogate marker of HLA-A2, was founded to be positively associated with the atrophy of the right hippocampus (P = 0.047) at baseline. Furthermore, we detected the above four associations in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subpopulation analysis. Our study provided preliminary evidences supporting HLA-A2 in Caucasians contribute to the risk of AD by modulating the alteration of hippocampal volume and HLA-A gene variants appear to play a role in altering AD-related brain structures on MRI.

"Transmission towers play an important role in transmitting electricity in a power grid safely and reliably. In traditional design practice, the second-order P-Delta (frame side sway) and P-delta (member curvature) effects and joint effects such as load eccentricities, slippage effects, and semirigid connection are commonly ignored in analysis. Great discrepancy is frequently noted between full-scale tower tests and numerical simulations using first-order linear analysis. In this paper, second-order direct analysis is used and slippage of bolted joints as well as semirigid connection behavior are taken into account. Member initial bowing and frame out-of-plumbness imperfections are considered in the present study, which is verified by full-scale test on an ultrahigh-voltage (UHV) lattice transmission tower. The technique of semirigid design and simulation of joint stiffness for load eccentricity by simple modeling for transmission towers meeting the requirements for direct analysis with verification by a full-scale test is unavailable in literature and proposed in this paper. Furthermore, the influences of joint slippage on the deflection and load behavior of the studied towers are quantified and reported. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

"The Markov random field (MRF) model has attracted great attention in the field of image segmentation. However, most MRF-based methods fail to resolve segmentation misclassification problems for high spatial resolution remote sensing images due to insufficiently using the hierarchical semantic information. In order to solve such a problem, this paper proposes an object-based MRF model with auxiliary label fields that can capture more macro and detailed information and apply it to the semantic segmentation of high spatial resolution remote sensing images. Specifically, apart from the label field, two auxiliary label fields are first introduced into the proposed model for interpreting remote sensing images from different perspectives, which are implemented by setting a different number of auxiliary classes. Then, the multilevel logistic model is used to describe the interactions within each label field, and a conditional probability distribution is developed to model the interactions between label fields. A net context structure is established among them to model the interactions of classes within and between label fields. A principled probabilistic inference is suggested to solve the proposed model by iteratively renewing the label field and auxiliary label fields, in which different information of auxiliary label fields can be integrated into the label field during iterations. Experiments on different remote sensing images demonstrate that our model produces more accurate segmentation than the state-of-the-art MRF-based methods. If some prior information is added, the proposed model can produce accurate results even in complex areas.

"Gasification is a promising alternative for polymeric waste valorization when mechanical recycling is unfeasible on account of its heterogeneity or partial contamination, or simply when it yields a product of lower quality than what the market requires. Apart from its application for electricity generation, the waste-derived syngas shows a great potential for chemical waste recycling for the synthesis of hydrogen, methane, natural gas or methanol. In spite of the effort devoted so far to the experimental demonstration of these processes to enable this technology to access commercial stage, it is still necessary to develop detailed models of the process that allow a precise prediction of the resulting syngas composition, as well as tar formation and global efficiency of the process. This research work presents the development of a polyolefin gasification model for fluidized bed reactors. The model details the behaviour of primary pyrolysis and homogeneous reactions of oxidation, steam reforming, aromatization and thermal cracking. To accomplish this, it adopts new modelling strategies for the definition of primary tar species in order to reflect their twofold nature (aliphatic and aromatic), as well as to describe kinetics and stoichiometry involved in thermal cracking processes of tar species. The model is able to successfully predict the generation, volume composition and heating value of the syngas, final tar generation and global efficiency of the process. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

"A growing number of studies have examined the immigrant paradox with respect to health behaviors in the United States. However, little research attention has been afforded to the study of adverse childhood experiences (ACE; neglect, physical and sexual abuse, and witnessing violence) among immigrants in the United States. The present study, using Waves I and II data from the National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), aims to address these gaps by comparing forms of ACE of first- and second-generation immigrants with native-born American adults in the United States. We also examined the latent structure of ACE among immigrants and conducted analyses to assess the psychiatric correlates of identified latent classes. With the exception of neglect, the prevalence of ACE was markedly higher among native-born Americans and second-generation immigrants compared with first-generation immigrants. Four latent classes were identifiedlimited adverse experience (n = 3,497), emotional and physical abuse (n = 1,262), family violence (n = 358), and global adversity (n = 246). The latter three classes evinced greater likelihood of being diagnosed with a mood, anxiety, personality, and substance use disorder, and to report violent and non-violent antisocial behavior. Consistent with prior research examining the associations between the immigrant paradox and health outcomes, results suggest that first-generation immigrants to the United States are less likely to have experienced physical and sexual abuse and witness domestic violence. However, likely due to cultural circumstances, first-generation immigrants were more likely to report experiences that are deemed neglectful by Western standards.

"Two nationwide representative studies (N5653 adolescents; N51007 adults) investigated the psychological correlates of the intention to penalize public expressions of prejudice in the form of support for hate-speech prohibition. We presented participants with preselected examples of hate speech from the Internet and other mass media and assessed their willingness to support the prohibition of public expressions of such remarks. Both studies found that social dominance orientation and right-wing authoritarianism are positively correlated with outgroup prejudice, but they have differential effects on hate-speech prohibition. Social dominance orientation was positively related to the acceptance of hate speech, whereas right-wing authoritarianism was positively related to hate-speech prohibition. In discussing this counterintuitive finding, we suggest that right-wing authoritarians are particularly vigilant toward norm violations-and this makes them more punitive toward counternormative expressions of prejudice, such as hate speech.

"In cryptography one needs large families of binary sequences with strong pseudorandom properties. In the last decades many families of this type have been constructed. However, in many applications it is not enough if our family of good sequences is large, it is more important to know that it has a rich, complex structure, and the sequences in the family are independent, and they are far apart. Thus various measures have been introduced and applied for studying pseudorandomness of families of binary sequences: family complexity, collision, distance minimum, avalanche effect and cross-correlation measure. In this paper a survey of all these definitions and results will be presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"Objectives: This study investigates how racial identity and phenotypicality (i.e., racial ambiguity) shape the perception of biracial individuals in both White and Black perceivers. We investigated complex racial categorization and its downstream consequences, such as perceptions of discrimination. Method: We manipulated racial phenotypicality (Black or racially ambiguous) and racial identity (Black or biracial) to test these cues' influence on Black and White race categorizations in a sample of both White (n = 145) and Black (n = 152) identified individuals. Results: Though racial identity and phenotypicality information influenced deliberate racial categorization, White and Black participants used the cues in different ways. For White perceivers, racial identity and phenotypicality additively influenced Black categorization. For Black perceivers, however, racial identity was only used in Black categorization when racial ambiguity was high. Perceived discrimination was related to White (but not Black) perceivers' distribution of minority resources to targets, however Black categorization related to perceived discrimination for Black perceivers only. Conclusion: By demonstrating how Black and White individuals use identity and phenotype information in race perceptions, we provide a more complete view of the complexities of racial categorization and its downstream consequences.

"Remote sensing platforms have consistently demonstrated the ability to detect, and in some cases identify, specific targets of interest, and photovoltaic solar panels are shown to have a unique spectral signature that is consistent across multiple manufacturers and construction methods. Solar panels are proven to be detectable in hyperspectral imagery using common statistical target detection methods such as the adaptive cosine estimator, and false alarms can be mitigated through the use of a spectral verification process that eliminates pixels that do not have the key spectral features of photovoltaic solar panel reflectance spectrum. The normalized solar panel index is described and is a key component in the false-alarm mitigation process. After spectral verification, these solar panel arrays are confirmed on openly available literal imagery and can be measured using numerous open-source algorithms and tools. The measurements allow for the assessment of overall solar power generation capacity using an equation that accounts for solar insolation, the area of solar panels, and the efficiency of the solar panels conversion of solar energy to power. Using a known location with readily available information, the methods outlined in this paper estimate the power generation capabilities within 6% of the rated power.

"Although the vast majority of existing work on empathy focuses exclusively on the socio-emotional consequences of empathizing with others' negative emotions, mounting evidence supports the view that empathy for others' negative emotions and empathy for others' positive emotions are distinct capacities. The present work seeks to marry this burgeoning literature on the separability of positive and negative empathy to the influential literature on approach and avoidance motivation by examining how these two distinct empathic capacities relate to the (pro)social motivations to assist others to approach positivity vs. avoid negativity. The results of two studies show that whereas positive empathy is associated with an other-focused motivation to assist others to approach positive outcomes and is predictive of helping only when that help is framed as a means of propelling others toward greater positivity, negative empathy is associated with an other-focused motivation to assist others to avoid negative outcomes and is associated with helping only when that help is framed as a means of assisting others to avoid further suffering. In addition to contributing to the emerging literature on the separability of positive and negative empathy, these results also help to extend the influential approach/avoidance distinction to the domain of other-focused motivation.

"The performance of geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) above arsenic-rich gold mine tailings was investigated by the construction of a test cover comprised of three GCL products placed above the tailings at an abandoned gold mine in Nova Scotia, Canada. In parallel research, the performance of the three commercially available GCLs was assessed based on a series of laboratory column experiments. Of the three needle-punched GCLs tested, one has untreated Wyoming bentonite and a woven carrier geotextile; the second has a polymer-enhanced Wyoming bentonite and a scrim-reinforced nonwoven carrier geotextile, and the third has a polymer-enhanced Wyoming bentonite and woven carrier geotextile coated by a thin polypropylene geofilm. After 4 years of exposure in the field and laboratory, the bentonite structure of all exhumed GCLs appeared to be well hydrated with no visible cracks provided that the cover soil thickness was >0.7 m. The GCL with untreated bentonite exhibited the highest reduction in the exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP; decreased to 1-3% in field and 4-29% in laboratory) and swell index (decreased to 7-12 ml/ 2 g in both field and laboratory tests). Despite this reduction in the swelling capacity, the maximum measured hydraulic conductivity (k)for this GCL was 1 3 1010 m/s, which is still considered low. The GCLs with polymer-enhanced bentonite experienced less cation exchange (ESP 10-27% in the field and 17-53% in the laboratory) than the GCL with untreated bentonite. The k values of the GCL with polymer-enhanced bentonite and non-coated carrier geotextile (3.6 x 10(-11) to 7.9 x 10(-11) m/s in the field and 1.6 3 10 11 to 6.7 3 10 11 m/s in the laboratory) were lower than those measured for the GCL with untreated bentonite. The lowest measured k values (3.6 3 10(-12) to 9.4 3 1012 m/s) were for the GCL with polymer-enhanced bentonite and geofilm coating the carrier geotextile. All three GCLs prevented the migration of arsenic to the overlying cover soil, even when the GCL was resting directly above the tailings without a foundation layer.

"Background: Against the background that crystal methamphetamine (colloquially known as tik) is extensively used by the emerging working class Coloured youth in Cape Town, South Africa, this exploratory qualitative study was conducted to explore the experience of mothers whose children use methamphetamine. Methods: The researchers conducted one-to-one semi-structured in-depth interviews with sixteen (16) purposively selected caregivers (mothers) whose sons use methamphetamine. Interviews were recorded and simultaneously translated and transcribed. Thematic analysis was used to identify themes related to the experiences of caregivers of youth with methamphetamine problems. Results: Findings showed that youth misbehaviour provided a context that led to feelings of shame and embarrassment. Participants also experienced personal challenges which included emotional problems, fear and self-blame. Participants also expressed family disruptions and financial drain as adverse experiences as a results of their sons' misbehaviour. Conclusion: The study results highlight the psychosocial challenges for caregivers of children who use methamphetamine. These findings underscore the need for effort to be directed at the development of formal support interventions for mothers of youth who are troubled with addiction.

"Water quality early warning system is mainly used to detect deliberate or accidental water pollution events in water distribution systems. Identifying the types of pollutants is necessary after detecting the presence of pollutants to provide warning information about pollutant characteristics and emergency solutions. Thus, a real-time contaminant classification methodology, which uses the multi-classification support vector machine (SVM), is proposed in this study to obtain the probability for contaminants belonging to a category. The SVM-based model selected samples with indistinct feature, which were mostly low-concentration samples as the support vectors, thereby reducing the influence of the concentration of contaminants in the building process of a pattern library. The new sample points were classified into corresponding regions after constructing the classification boundaries with the support vector. Experimental results show that the multi-classification SVM-based approach is less affected by the concentration of contaminants when establishing a pattern library compared with the cosine distance classification method. Moreover, the proposed approach avoids making a single decision when classification features are unclear in the initial phase of injecting contaminants.

"High dimensionality and classification of imbalanced data sets are two of the most interesting machine learning challenges. Both issues have been independently studied in the literature. In order to simultaneously explore the both issues of feature selection and oversampling, we efficiently combine two different methodological approaches in an unified kernel framework. Specifically, we proposed a novel l(2,1) norm balanced multiple kernel feature selection (l(2,1) MKFS), and designed a proximal based optimization algorithm for efficiently learning the model. Moreover, multiple kernel oversampling (MKOS) was developed to generate synthetic instances in the optimal kernel space induced by l(2,1) MKFS, so as to compensate for the class imbalanced distribution. Our experimental results on multiple UCI data and two real medical application demonstrate that jointly operating nonlinear feature selection and oversampling with l(2,1) norm multi-kernel learning framework (l(2,1) MKFSOS) can lead to a promising classification performance.

"Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is a promising tool for supplementing surface water and groundwater supply to overcome imbalance between water supply and demand under changing climatic conditions. The main aim of this study is to present a technically robust and pragmatic methodology for evaluating rainwater harvesting potential and identifying suitable sites for RWH and artificial recharge structures using Geographic Information System (GIS)-based multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). Unlike past studies, this study proposes an approach to prioritize zones/sites for RWH and recharge structures, which is of great importance for the effective implementation of RWH strategies. The derived themes 'runoff coefficient' and the basic themes of 'slope' and 'drainage density' were used for mapping rainwater harvesting potential. Thereafter, suitable zones and sites for feasible RWH and recharge structures were identified using suitability criteria and GIS-based Boolean logic. In addition, identified zones/sites were prioritized based on the themes of key factors viz., post-monsoon groundwater level, groundwater fluctuation and water demand. After normalizing the weights of the themes and their features, the themes were integrated in GIS environment. The study area was divided into four RWH potential zones with 47% and 38% of the study area falling under 'high' and 'moderate' RWH potential, respectively. On the other hand, the study area was classified into four rainwater harvesting demand zones namely, (a) 'very high' (29% of the study area), (b) 'high' (26.4%), (c) 'moderate' (213%), and (d) 'low' (23.6%). The zones suitable for constructing farm ponds cover 2314 km(2) and those for percolation tanks on the ground cover 42 km(2). Further, 69 sites for percolation tanks along the streams and 33 sites for check dams were also identified as suitable locations over the study area. Framework for the prioritization of suitable zones/sites for RWH and groundwater recharge is proposed in this study by integrating 'rainwater harvesting potential' and 'rainwater harvesting demand' maps. The integrated geospatial and MCDA approach is not only time saving and cost-effective but also very helpful for the efficient planning and management of rainwater at a larger scale.

"Blood acid-base regulation by specialized epithelia, such as gills and kidney, requires the ability to sense blood acid-base status. Here, we developed primary cultures of ray (Urolophus halleri) gill cells to study mechanisms for acid-base sensing without the interference of whole animal hormonal regulation. Ray gills have abundant base-secreting cells, identified by their noticeable expression of vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (VHA), and also express the evolutionarily conserved acid-base sensor soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC). Exposure of cultured cells to extracellular alkalosis (pH 8.0, 40 mM HCO3-) triggered VHA translocation to the cell membrane, similar to previous reports in live animals experiencing blood alkalosis. VHA translocation was dependent on sAC, as it was blocked by the sAC-specific inhibitor KH7. Ray gill base-secreting cells also express transmembrane adenylyl cyclases (tmACs); however, tmAC inhibition by 2', 5'-dideoxyadenosine did not prevent alkalosis-dependent VHA translocation, and tmAC activation by forskolin reduced the abundance of VHA at the cell membrane. This study demonstrates that sAC is a necessary and sufficient sensor of extracellular alkalosis in ray gill base-secreting cells. In addition, this study indicates that different sources of cAMP differentially modulate cell biology.

"Background: We aimed to evaluate the potential benefits of the Leadership and Coaching for Health (LEACH) program on physical activity (PA), dietary habits, and distress management in cancer survivors. Methods: We randomly assigned 248 cancer survivors with an allocation ratio of two-to-one to the LEACH program (LP) group, coached by long-term survivors, or the usual care (UC) group. At baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months, we used PA scores, the intake of vegetables and fruits (VF), and the Post Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) as primary outcomes and, for secondary outcomes, the Ten Rules for Highly Effective Health Behavior adhered to and quality of life (QOL), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). Results: For primary outcomes, the two groups did not significantly differ in PA scores or VF intake but differed marginally in PTGI. For secondary outcomes, the LP group showed a significantly greater improvement in the HADS anxiety score, the social functioning score, and the appetite loss and financial difficulties scores of the EORTC QLQ-C30 scales from baseline to 3 months. From baseline to 12 months, the LP group showed a significantly greater decrease in the EORTC QLQ-C30 fatigue score and a significantly greater increase in the number of the Ten Rules for Highly Effective Health Behavior. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that the LEACH program, coached by long-term survivors, can provide effective management of the QOL of cancer survivors but not of their PA or dietary habits.

"Heavy metal migration was evaluated in Pb-Zn tailings covered by different topsoil constructions. The four topsoil constructions each had different interlayers: one with direct topsoiling above the tailings (CT); the second had a limestone interlayer between the tailings and topsoil with two geotextile layers set above and below the interlayer (SLS); the third had a lime interlayer, also with two geotextile layers (SL); and the fourth had a clay interlayer with two geotextile layers (SC). The topsoils were evaluated in a 210-day laboratory column leaching experiments and in a 3-year field cover application at an abandoned Pb-Zn tailings pond (northeastern China). The contents of Pb, Zn and Cd in the soils, leachates, interlayers and leaves of Amotpha fruticosa L were analysed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Results showed that the pH values of the leachates from the columns increased with time, from 6.5 to the range of 7.5 to 8.03, and the maximum in pH in Cl (tailings), C2 (CT), C3 (SLS), C4 (SL) and C5 (SC) appeared after the 180th day, at 7.85, 7.89, 7.78, 8.03, and 7.89, respectively. The topsoil effectively reduced the concentrations of Pb, Zn and Cd in the leachate, and the addition of a limestone or lime interlayer enhanced the efficiency, especially for Zn and Cd. The Pb, Zn and Cd concentrations in the topsoil that directly cover the tailings were appreciably less than the initial concentrations, resulting from the eluviation. The presence of a limestone or lime interlayer reduced the mobility of Zn and Cd, and a clay interlayer was effective in preventing the migration of Pb and Zn but had less impact on Cd. During the 3-year field experiment, the pH values of the topsoil increased slightly with time, from 7.15 to the range of 7.67 to 820. At the end of the experiment, Pb, Zn and Cd concentrations in the topsoil at the SLS, SL and SC plots showed little change compared with the initial value in 2012. Acid-soluble Pb, Zn and Cd concentrations of the upper soil (0-0.1 m) at CT increased from 0.19, 1.95 and 0.11 mg kg(-1) in 2012 to 1.82, 32.87 and 0.56 mg kg(-1) in 2015, indicating that acid-soluble heavy metals migrated from tailings to topsoil. Acid-soluble Cd in topsoil and in the interlayer showed a small increase at plot SC, indicating that Cd may migrate through the clay layer to topsoil with pore water. The Pb contents in leaves at SLS and SL were 238 and 3.04 mg kg(-1), which were appreciably lower than at CT and SC, and the Zn and Cd contents in leaves at CT were 45.78 and 0.26 mg kg(-1), which were higher than at SLS, SL and SC. Topsoiling with an interlayer could be a reliable technique for preventing toxic elements from moving downward or upward during ecological restoration of tailings ponds. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"This paper presents the analysis, design, and hardware implementation of a digital polynomial Regulation, Steady-State Error and Tracking (RST) current controller-based third-harmonic modulated boost-type power factor correction (PFC) rectifier. The proposed rectifier is used at the front end of a vector controlled induction motor drive (VCIMD) to eliminate harmonics at the input AC supply. The proposed PFC rectifier modifies the input current to a sinusoid with unity power factor apart from offering DC bus voltage regulation. In this paper, a digital proportional-integral (PI) and RST current controllers are compared in terms of total harmonic distortion (THD) and power factor (PF) at the point of common coupling for different loading conditions. The RST current controller tracks the set-point accurately with zero steady-state error and offers good disturbance rejection that enables further reduction of supply current THD as compared to a conventional PI current controller. The control algorithm for the PFC front end rectifier along with vector control technique is implemented using a digital signal processor, and the dynamic performance is analyzed for step changes in reference speed and load torques, demonstrating significant improvement in the performance indices.

"Early-onset muscle disease includes three major entities that present generally at or before birth: congenital myopathies, congenital muscular dystrophies and congenital myasthenic syndromes. Almost exclusively there is weakness and hypotonia, although cases manifesting hypertonia are increasingly being recognised. These diseases display a wide phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity, with the uptake of next generation sequencing resulting in an unparalleled extension of the phenotype-genotype correlations and diagnosis by sequencing due to unbiased sequencing. Perhaps now more than ever, detailed clinical evaluations are necessary to guide the genetic diagnosis; with arrival at a molecular diagnosis frequently occurring following dialogue between the molecular geneticist, the referring clinician and the pathologist. There is an ever-increasing blurring of the boundaries between the congenital myopathies, dystrophies and myasthenic syndromes. In addition, many novel disease genes have been described and new insights have been gained into skeletal muscle development and function. Despite the advances made, a significant percentage of patients remain without a molecular diagnosis, suggesting that there are many more human disease genes and mechanisms to identify. It is now technically- and clinically-feasible to perform next generation sequencing for severe diseases on a population-widescale, such that preconception-carrier screening can occur. Newborn screening for selected early-onset muscle diseases is also technically and ethically-achievable, with benefits to the patient and family from early management of these diseases and should also be implemented. The need for world-wide Reference Centres to meticulously curate polymorphisms and mutations within a particular gene is becoming increasingly apparent, particularly for interpretation of variants in the large genes which cause early-onset myopathies: NEB, RYR1 and TTN. Functional validation of candidate disease variants is crucial for accurate interpretation of next generation sequencing and appropriate genetic counseling. Many published pathogenic variants are too frequent in control populations and are thus likely rare polymorphisms. Mechanisms need to be put in place to systematically update the classification of variants such that accurate interpretation of variants occurs. In this review, we highlight the recent advances made and the challenges ahead for the molecular diagnosis of early-onset muscle diseases. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"The increasing complexity of the new breed of distributed intelligent systems, such as the Internet of Things, which require a diversity of languages and protocols, can only be tamed with design and programming best practices. Interest is also growing for including the human factor, as advocated by the ambient intelligence (AmI) research field, whose focus is on transparently and intelligently supporting people. These new design methodologies are increasingly needed in the tool-box of new electronic and computer engineers, and teaching strategies should be devised that allow students to acquire a systems-level view instead of getting lost in technology-oriented approaches. This paper describes a study carried out over two academic years, in a course in AmI at Politecnico di Torino, Italy. In the course, a project-based learning approach was adopted, in which students design and prototype an AmI system, and their progress is closely monitored throughout the semester. This paper presents the learning goals and teaching strategies, analyzes the learning outcomes from the qualitative and quantitative points of view, and highlights the lessons learned in the process.

"Compositionality is a property of natural language which is of prime importance: It enables humans to form and conceptualize potentially novel and complex ideas, by combining words. On the other hand, the symbol grounding problem examines the way meaning is anchored to entities external to language, such as sensory percepts and sensory-motor routines. In this paper we aim towards the exploration of the intersection of compositionality and symbol grounding. We thus propose a methodology for constructing empirically derived models of grounded meaning, which afford composition of grounded semantics. We illustrate our methodology for the case of adjectival modifiers. Grounded models of adjectively modified and unmodified colors are acquired through a specially designed procedure with 134 participants, and then computational models of the modifiers dark and light are derived. The generalization ability of these learnt models is quantitatively evaluated, and their usage is demonstrated in a real-world physical humanoid robot. We regard this as an important step towards extending empirical approaches for symbol grounding so that they can accommodate compositionality: a necessary step towards the deep understanding of natural language for situated embodied agents, such as sensor-enabled ambient intelligence and interactive robots.

"Liver transplantation is a promising and widely-accepted treatment for patients with terminal liver disease. However, transplantation is restricted by the lack of suitable donors, resulting in significant waiting list deaths. This paper proposes a novel donor-recipient allocation system that uses machine learning to predict graft survival after transplantation using a dataset comprised of donor-recipient pairs from the King's College Hospital (United Kingdom). The main novelty of the system is that it tackles the imbalanced nature of the dataset by considering semi-supervised learning, analysing its potential for obtaining more robust and equitable models in liver transplantation. We propose two different sources of unsupervised data for this specific problem (recent transplants and virtual donor-recipient pairs) and two methods for using these data during model construction (a semi-supervised algorithm and a label propagation scheme). The virtual pairs and the label propagation method are shown to alleviate the imbalanced distribution. The results of our experiments show that the use of synthetic and real unsupervised information helps to improve and stabilise the performance of the model and leads to fairer decisions with respect to the use of only supervised data. Moreover, the best model is combined with the Model for End-stage Liver Disease score (MELD), which is at the moment the most popular assignation methodology worldwide. By doing this, our decision-support system considers both the compatibility of the donor and the recipient (by our prediction system) and the recipient severity (via the MELD score), supporting then the principles of fairness and benefit.

"Food poisoning by Staphylococcus aureus is a result of ingestion of Staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) produced by this bacterium and is a major source of foodborne illness. Staphylococcal enterotoxin D (SED) is one of the predominant enterotoxins recovered in Staphylococcal food poisoning incidences, including a recent outbreak in Guam affecting 300 children. Current immunology methods for SED detection cannot distinguish between the biologically active form of the toxin, which poses a threat, from the inactive form, which poses no threat. In vivo bioassays that measure emetic activity in kitten and monkeys have been used, but these methods rely upon expensive procedures using live animals and raising ethical concerns. A rapid (5 h) quantitative bioluminescence assay, using a genetically engineered T-cell Jurkat cell line expressing luciferase under regulation of nuclear factor of activated T cells response elements, in combination with the lymphoblastoid B-cell line Raji for antigen presentation, was developed. In this assay, the detection limit of biologically active SED is 100 ng/mL, which is 10 times more sensitive than the splenocyte proliferation assay, and 105 times more sensitive than monkey or kitten bioassay. Pasteurization or repeated freeze-thaw cycles had no effect on SED activity, but reduction in SED activity was shown with heat treatment at 100 degrees C for 5 min. It was also shown that milk exhibits a protective effect on SED. This bioluminescence assay may also be used to rapidly evaluate antibodies to SED for potential therapeutic application as a measurement of neutralizing biological effects of SED.

"A history of ever-smoking appears to be associated with a more severe disease phenotype in axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). However, evidence is sparse for the effect of increased smoking exposure on disease outcomes or whether smoking reduction or cessation improves outcomes. The aim of this study was to explore whether a dose-response relationship exists between pack-years and disease activity and functional impairment in axSpA. Consecutive patients meeting ASAS criteria for axial SpA were recruited from a spondyloarthritis service. The associations between pack-years of smoking and: (1) disease activity (BASDAI/ASDAS), (2) spinal pain, (3) functional impairment (BASFI) and (4) inflammatory markers were explored using multivariable linear models, adjusted for age, gender and use of TNF inhibition (TNFi) therapy. Pack-years were categorised into four groups (40) and analysed with light smoking (40, beta = 2.6 (0.54, 3.56)), higher BASFI (21-40, beta = 2.1 (0.42, 4.80); >40, beta = 3.2 (0.76, 5.71)), and higher ASDAS (21-40, beta = 0.82 (0.14, 1.51)). This cross-sectional study demonstrated that smoking is associated with increased axSpA severity markers in a dose-response manner. Particular effort should be made to restrict smoking exposure early before accruing a significant number of pack-years.

"Wireless networks have gained immense popularity in recent years. Though wireless networks have innumerous advantages over conventional wired networks, the borderless nature of wireless networks makes it prone to various felonious activities. In the context of network security, one of the most crucial vulnerabilities which have caused a serious global concern is the MAC Address Spoofing. MAC address spoofing facilitates launching of other attacks such as Denial-of-service, Man-in-the-middle, SYN flooding etc. In this paper we propose a methodology for the detection of spoofing attacks in IEEE 802.11 networks that involve performance of cluster analysis on RSS patterns of 802.11 transmitters which not only detect presence of a spoofing attack but also determine number of attackers. Further for localizing the adversaries, we propose a discriminant-adaptive neural network (DANN) based localization system.

"Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) is a reproductive and developmental toxicant in animals and a suspected endocrine modulator in humans. There is widespread exposure to DEHP in the general population. Patients can be additionally exposed through DEHP-containing medical devices. Toxicokinetic and metabolic knowledge on DEHP in humans is vital not only for the toxicological evaluation of DEHP but also for exposure assessments based on human biomonitoring data. Secondary oxidized DEHP metabolites like mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (5OH-MEHP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl)phthalate (5oxo-MEHP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl)phthalate (5cx-MEPP) and mono-[2-(carboxymethyl)hexyl]phthalate (2cx-MMHP) are most valuable biomarkers of DEHP exposure. They represent the major share of DEHP metabolites excreted in urine (about 70% for these four oxidized metabolites vs. about 6% for MEHP); they are immune to external contamination and possibly the ultimate developmental toxicants. Long half-times of elimination make 5cx-MEPP and 2cx-MMHP excellent parameters to measure the time-weighted body burden to DEHP. 5OH-MEHP and 5oxo-MEHP more reflect the short-term exposure. We calculated the daily DEHP intake for the general population (n = 85) and for children (n = 254). Children were significantly higher exposed to DEHP than adults. Exposures at the 95th percentile (21 and 25 mu g/kg/day, respectively) scooped out limit values like the Reference Dose (RfD, 20 mu g/kg/day) and the Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI, 20-48 mu g/kg/day) to a considerable degree. Up to 20-fold oversteppings for some children give cause for concern. We also detected significant DEHP exposures for voluntary platelet donors (n = 12, 38 mu g/kg/apheresis, dual-needle technique). Premature neonates (n = 45) were exposed to DEHP up to 100 times above the limit values depending on the intensity of medical care (median: 42 mu g/kg/day; 95th percentile: 1780 mu g/kg/day).

"Amyloid beta-peptide (A beta) is now considered as a key predictor for preclinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), whose diagnosis is still hampered by the lack of early, sensitive, and convenient tools. Herein, we propose a colorimetric sandwich immunosensor for A beta((1-42)) based on dual antibody-modified gold nanoparticles. Bare AuNPs are successfully coated with N-terminal antibody of A beta((1-42))) (N-Ab((1-42))AuNP) and C-terminal antibody of A beta((1-42)) (C-Ab((1-42)))-AuNP), respectively. Subsequently, A beta(142) can be simultaneously captured by the prepared AuNPs@C/N-Ab((1-42))) (C-Ab((1-42)))-AuNP:N-Ab((1)-(42))-AuNP =1:1) owing to the specific binding of N- and C-terminal antibody with A beta((1-42)), and thus the AuNPs@C/NAb((1-42)) are aggregated, accompanying with obvious color change from red to blue. By means of this colorimetric sandwich immunosensor system, a good linearity within a range from 7.5 nM to 350 nM is found, with a detection limit of 2.3 nM, which is equal to or better than other reported detection methods for A beta((1-42)). The newly colorimetric sandwich immunosensor system strikingly achieves specific, visual and simply detection of Ail and can be exploited toward the determination of other similar biomarkers related to diseases in biological or biomedical diagnosis.

"Adapting application to diverse/dynamic domains is required to enlarge pervasive computing use and to satisfy people demand in terms of continuity of services. In addition, the proliferation of smart devices and ubiquitous services motivate the need for a quick development of applications that support people in dynamic domains. Inappropriately, this quick development is often associated a discard of domain knowledge. Therefore, we target in our research raising the level of adaptation for rapid application development in dynamic domains. In this paper, we present our work to improve the formal definition of domain knowledge/applications to be created by domain experts. We propose our context-based semantic framework (i.e., AmI-DEU) used to create dynamic domain models that are the basis for building applications. In this framework, domain knowledge is described by means of meaningful context that include unambiguous terms and operations, resulting in an enhancement of adaptation of applications. We also present in this paper the applicability of the framework to describe dynamic domains and context-based services, as well as, to develop micro context-aware applications that negotiate and interchange context, and consume services in multiple computational spaces.

"Direct eye contact is a powerful social cue to regulate interpersonal interactions. Previous behavioral studies showed a link between eye contact and motor mimicry, indicating that the automatic mimicry of observed hand movements is significantly enhanced when direct eye contact exists between the observer and the observed model. In the present study, we aim to investigate the neurophysiological basis of the previously reported behavioral enhancements. Here, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied to assess changes in cortico-motor excitability at the level of the primary motor cortex (MI) to explore whether and how the motor system is facilitated from observing others' hand movements and, in particular, how this process is modulated by eye contact. To do so, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were collected from two hand muscles while participants received single-pulse TMS and naturally observed video clips of an actor showing hand opening movements or static hands. During the observation, either direct or averted eye gaze was established between the subject and the observed actor. Our findings show a clear effect of eye gaze on observation-induced motor facilitation. This indicates that the mapping or 'mirroring' of others' movements is significantly enhanced when movement observation is accompanied by direct eye gaze compared to averted eye gaze. Our results support the notion that eye contact is a powerful social signal with the ability to direct human non-verbal social behavior. Furthermore, our findings are important for understanding the role of the mirror motor system in the mapping of socially relevant actions.

"In this paper, for the first time, we developed an analytical model for the surface potential of the double-gate p-n-p-n tunneling field-effect transistors (TFETs) considering the effect of localized charges at the Si-SiO2 interface near the source-channel junction. From the surface potential model, the minimum tunneling width is then evaluated and is used to extract the threshold voltage using the constant-current method. The model can be applied to study the effect of localized charges on the threshold voltage of the p-n-p-n TFETs as it captures the shift in the threshold voltage due to the change in the localized charge region length, localized charge density, and polarity. The accuracy of the proposed model is verified using 2-D Technology Computer-Aided Design simulations.

"Typically-developing (TD) children frequently refer to objects uniquely in gesture. Parents translate these gestures into words, facilitating children's acquisition of these words (Goldin-Meadow et al. in Dev Sci 10(6):778-785, 2007). We ask whether this pattern holds for children with autism (AU) and with Down syndrome (DS) who show delayed vocabulary development. We observed 23 children with AU, 23 with DS, and 23 TD children with their parents over a year. Children used gestures to indicate objects before labeling them and parents translated their gestures into words. Importantly, children benefited from this input, acquiring more words for the translated gestures than the not translated ones. Results highlight the role contingent parental input to child gesture plays in language development of children with developmental disorders.

"Purpose of review Endometrial cancer incidence is increasing in North America and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in women. We review recent literature published on treatment of endometrial cancer and highlight areas of active interest. Recent findings There has been movement toward minimal invasive surgery at diagnosis; lymph node staging remains controversial and continues to be investigated. Progress has been made to establish consensus on endometrial cancer risk classification to promote consistency for future trial design. Molecular characterization of endometrial cancer and its integration into clinicopathological profiling to develop predictive biomarkers for treatment selection are active areas of research. Optimal adjuvant treatment strategy in high-risk endometrial cancer remains to be defined with recognition of treatment-related toxicity. Despite encouraging results in drug development for treatment of advanced/recurrent endometrial cancer, no targeted therapies beyond hormonal therapy are approved. There is an urgent need for scientifically validated therapy with predictive biomarkers. Summary Our understanding of endometrial cancer has evolved through improvements in molecular biology, allowing improved definition of target-specific therapies. The precise role and sequence of conventional and targeted therapies, including immunotherapy, will require careful attention to the design of clinical trials with translational emphasis to allow the discovery, validation, and implementation of predictive biomarkers into clinical care.

"Flower-like PbS/Ni2P composites were synthesized by a facile two-step chemical route. The morphology and structure of the resulting composites were investigated by SEM and TEM images and XRD spectra, respectively. The results showed that the as-obtained composites were composed of the cubic PbS flowers and hexagonal Ni2P nanoparticles, and Ni2P nanoparticles coated on the surfaces of flower-like PbS microstructure. It was found that changing the molar ratio to 3:1, flower-like PbS/Ni2P composites have been successfully synthesized by using cationic cetyltrimethylammonium bromide(CTAB) and anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as template. Furthermore, using methylene blue(MB) as a model organic pollutant, the photocatalytic degradation experiments indicated that the as-prepared composites showed enhanced photocatalytic degradation activity for methylene blue(75%) which is as higher as that of the only flower-like PbS (16.6%) and only Ni2P nanoparticles (44.8%) at the same time. This work may be expected to find its potential application in water pollution treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"People read dominance, trustworthiness and competence into the faces of politicians but do they also perceive such social qualities in other nonverbal cues? We transferred the body movements of politicians giving a speech onto animated stick-figures and presented these stimuli to participants in a rating-experiment. Analyses revealed single body postures of maximal expansiveness as strong predictors of perceived dominance. Also, stick-figures producing expansive movements as well as a great number of movements throughout the encoded sequences were judged high on dominance and low on trustworthiness. In a second step we divided our sample into speakers from the opposition parties and speakers that were part of the government as well as into male and female speakers. Male speakers from the opposition were rated higher on dominance but lower on trustworthiness than speakers from all other groups. In conclusion, people use simple cues to make equally simple social categorizations. Moreover, the party status of male politicians seems to become visible in their body motion. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Her teaching method -the Montessori Method- is still used worldwide. Because she could not speak English during the imprisonment in India, there was a big obstacle for her communication with children. However, the need to adopt a non-verbal communication, led her to a sensational discovery: children use an innate and universal language. This language, made of gestures and mimic, is called extra verbal communication.

"Chlamydia trachomatis genital infection is the most common sexually transmitted bacterial disease, causing a significant burden to females due to reproductive dysfunction. Intensive screening and antibiotic treatment are unable to completely prevent female reproductive dysfunction, thus, efforts have become focused on developing a vaccine. A major impediment is identifying a safe and effective adjuvant which induces cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) cells with attributes capable of halting genital infection and inflammation. Previously, we described a natural nanocapsule called the vault which was engineered to contain major outer membrane protein (MOMP) and was an effective vaccine which significantly reduced early infection and favored development of a cellular immune response in a mouse model. In the current study, we used another chlamydial antigen, a polymorphic membrane protein G-1 (PmpG) peptide, to track antigen-specific cells and evaluate, in depth, the vault vaccine for its protective capacity in the absence of an added adjuvant. We found PmpG-vault immunized mice significantly reduced the genital bacterial burden and histopathologic parameters of inflammation following a C. muridarum challenge. Immunization boosted antigen-specific CD4 cells with a multiple cytokine secretion pattern and reduced the number of inflammatory cells in the genital tract making the vault vaccine platform safe and effective for chlamydial genital infection. We conclude that vaccination with a Chlamydia-vault vaccine boosts antigen-specific immunities that are effective at eradicating infection and preventing reproductive tract inflammation.

"In order to improve the possibility of successful bonding and performance of structures, the new method for multi-depth silicon etching is required. This paper aims to design and create a new method for one-time multi-depth silicon etching in manufacturing complex structures based on SiO2 masking layer. The core idea of this method is that: Firstly, all patterns are transferred into photo resist through photo etching; Then etch pattern will be transferred in the SiO2 masking layer by multi-time shallow etching with different time etching control; Finally, patterns will be transferred to the silicon wafer with uniform ratio based on the measured etching selectivity of SiO2-Si with one time. In the experiments, the process is completed in the silicon wafer with SiO2 masking layer whose thickness is elaborately designed. Firstly, the etching rate of SiO2 and the etching selectivity of SiO2-Si were measured accurately. Secondly, the shallow structure based on the designed structure, the etching rate of SiO2 and the etching selectivity of SiO2-Si is etched on the SiO2 masking layer. The second step forms different thickness version of SiO2 masking layer. At last, the SiO2 masking layer is etched until final structure and consequently different depth of groove accomplish due to various thickness of SiO2 etched by previous step. The experimental results indicated that the new methods has at least three advantages compared to traditional method: That is faster efficiency, higher cleanness and more complex structure. Fast work efficiency owes to only SF6 etching rather than two gases of SF6 and C4F8 to reduce half of time. Also high cleanness comes from being not exposed to air and researchers directly. The largest benefit of new method may be that can create more complex structure for higher required machine design and for higher mechanical function. It is because that normal etching method could only build few different depth of grooves due to multi-process limitation and contrary to normal one, new method can create more different depth of groove. And more different depth of groove means that more complex structure can be designed.

"This paper presents a novel control circuit that eliminates signal overshoot inherent to digital step attenuators (DSA) during state transitions. With the addition of digital delay elements, transitions from attenuation state to insertion loss state is delayed with respect to the transition from the insertion loss state to the attenuation state. This prevents unintended signal leakage to the output, eliminating possible signal overshoot. Since this novel technique achieves signal overshoot suppression with a simple addition to the digital control circuit, it is area efficient, and can be applied to any digital attenuator without degrading its RF performance. To present its effectiveness, the proposed technique is employed in a 6-bit DSA. The resulting reduced-overshoot DSA is manufactured in a commercial 0.18 mu m Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) process. Measurement results show that this technique successfully suppresses the signal overshoot to less than 0.2 dB.

"The interaction of cells with their natural environment influences a large variety of cellular phenomena, including cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration. The complex extracellular matrix network has challenged the attempts to replicate in vitro the heterogeneity of the cell environment and has threatened, in general, the relevance of in vitro studies. In this work, we describe a new and extremely versatile approach to generate native-like extracellular matrices with controlled morphologies for the in vitro study of cellular processes. This general approach combines the confluent culture of fibroblasts with microfabricated guiding templates to direct the three-dimensional growth of well-defined extracellular networks which recapitulate the structural and biomolecular complexity of features typically found in vivo. To evaluate its performance, we studied fundamental cellular processes, including cell cytoskeleton organization, cell-matrix adhesion, proliferation, and protrusions morphodynamics. In all cases, we found striking differences depending on matrix architecture and, in particular, when compared to standard two-dimensional environments. We also assessed whether the engineered matrix networks influenced cell migration dynamics and locomotion strategy, finding enhanced migration efficiency for cells seeded on aligned matrices. Altogether, our methodology paves the way to the development of high-performance models of the extracellular matrix for potential applications in tissue engineering, diagnosis, or stem-cell biology.

"IPv6 was designed to solve the issue of adopting IPv4 addresses by presenting a large number of address spaces. Currently, many networking devices consider IPv6 as a supportive IPv6-enabled device that includes routers, notebooks, personal computers, and mobile phones. Security has increasingly become a significant issue in exploiting networks and obtaining the benefits of IPv6. One of the important protocols in IPv6 implementation that is used for neighbor and router discovery is ICMPv6. However, this protocol can be used by attackers to deny network services through ICMPv6 DDoS flooding attacks that decrease the network performance. To solve this problem, this study proposes an intelligent ICMPv6 DDoS flooding-attack detection framework using back-propagation neural network (v6IIDS) in IPv6 networks. This study also explores and analyzes the detection accuracy of the proposed v6IIDS framework. The effectiveness of the v6IIDS framework is demonstrated by using real data-sets obtained from an NAv6 laboratory. The data-set traffic is based on a test-bed environment created on the basis of certain parameters used as inputs to generate a new data-set. The results prove that the proposed framework is capable of detecting ICMPv6 DDoS flood attacks with a detection accuracy rate of 98.3%.

"Glioma is still difficult to treat because of its high malignancy, high recurrence rate, and high resistance to anticancer drugs. An alternative method for research of gliomagenesis and drug resistance is to use in vitro tumor model that closely mimics the in vivo tumor microenvironment. In this study, we established a 3D bioprinted glioma stem cell model, using modified porous gelatin/alginate/ fibrinogen hydrogel that mimics the extracellular matrix. Glioma stem cells achieved a survival rate of 86.92%, and proliferated with high cellular activity immediately following bioprinting. During the in vitro culture period, the printed glioma stem cells not only maintained their inherent characteristics of cancer stem cells (Nestin), but also showed differentiation potential (glial fibrillary acidic protein and beta-tubulin III). In order to verify the vascularization potential of glioma stem cells, tumor angiogenesis biomarker, vascular endothelial growth factor was detected by immunohistochemistry, and its expression increased from week one to three during the culture period. Drug-sensitivity results showed that 3D printed tumor model was more resistant to temozolomide than 2D monolayer model at TMZ concentrations of 400-1600 mu g ml(-1). In summary, 3D bioprinted glioma model provides a novel alternative tool for studying gliomagenesis, glioma stem cell biology, drug resistance, and anticancer drug susceptibility in vitro.

"In the present work, the dynamic behavior of inertial fibers suspended in a turbulent vertical channel flow has been investigated. The three-dimensional turbulent flow field was obtained from the Navier-Stokes equations by means of direct numerical simulation in an Eulerian reference frame. The fibers were modeled as prolate spheroidal particles in a Lagrangian frame and characterized by their inertia and shape. The translation and rotation of the individual fibers were governed by viscous forces and torques as well as by gravity and buoyancy according to Newton's laws of motion. The test matrix comprised four different Stokes numbers (inertia) and three different aspect ratios (shape). The twelve different fiber types were suspended both in a downward and in an upward channel flow. Fiber orientation and velocity statistics were compared with channel flow results in absence of gravity. The results showed that gravity has a negligible effect for fibers with modest inertia, i.e. low Stokes numbers, whereas gravity turned out to have a major impact on the dynamics of highly inertial fibers. Irrespective of the bulk flow direction, a preferential alignment of the inertial fibers with the gravity force was found in the channel center where fibers have been known to orient randomly in absence of gravity. In the downward channel flow, the drift velocity of the fibers towards the walls was substantially higher for fibers than for spheres and also higher than when gravity was neglected. In the upward flow configuration, the modest drift velocity of inertial spheres was totally quenched for all fibers irrespective of shape. The suppressed drift velocity resulted in a more uniform fiber distribution throughout the channel as compared to the distinct near-wall accumulation in downward flow and in absence of gravity. This suggests that an upward flow configuration should be the preferred choice if a uniform fiber distribution is desired, as in a biomass combustion reactor. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"An attack graph depicts multiple-step attack and provides a description of system security vulnerabilities. It illustrates critical information necessary to identify potential weaknesses and areas for enhanced defense. Attack graphs include multiple attack paths, which are a focus for further detailed analysis and risk mitigation. Considering that different vulnerabilities have different probabilities of being exploited, this paper proposes an algorithm to dynamically generate the top K attack paths with maximum probabilities for every node of a system. The proposed algorithm does not require generation of the full attack graph to calculate the K attack paths. Instead, it directly processes and analyzes the system input data and dynamically identifies the K attack paths. The computational time, based upon the complexity of the attack paths, can be constrained by the parameter K. Experimental results show that the algorithm is scalable and efficient.

"Once thought to be uniquely human, prosocial behavior has been observed in a number of species, including vampire bats that engage in costly food-sharing. Another social chiropteran, Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis), have been observed to engage in cooperative mate guarding, and thus might be expected to display prosocial behavior as well. However, frugivory and hematophagy diets may impose different selection pressures on prosocial preferences, given that prosocial preferences may depend upon cognitive abilities selected by different ecological constraints. Thus, we assessed whether Jamaican fruit bats would assist a conspecific in an escape paradigm in which a donor could opt to release a recipient from an enclosure. The test apparatus contained two compartments-one of which was equipped with a sensor that, once triggered, released the trap door of the adjacent compartment. Sixty-six exhaustive pairs of 12 bats were tested, with each bat in each role, twice when the recipient was present and twice when absent. Bats decreased their behavior of releasing the trapdoor in both conditions over time, decreasing the behavior slightly more rapidly in the recipient absent condition. Bats did not release the door more often when recipients were present, regardless of the recipient; thus, there was no clear evidence of prosocial behavior.

"Vessel segmentation is a critical task for various medical applications, such as diagnosis assistance of diabetic retinopathy, quantification of cerebral aneurysm's growth, and guiding surgery in neurosurgical procedures. Despite technology advances in image segmentation, existing methods still suffer from low accuracy for vessel segmentation in the two challenging while common scenarios in clinical usage: (1) regions with a low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), and (2) at vessel boundaries disturbed by adjacent non-vessel pixels. In this paper, we present an automated system which can achieve highly accurate vessel segmentation for both 2D and 3D images even under these challenging scenarios. Three key contributions achieved by our system are: (1) a progressive contrast enhancement method to adaptively enhance contrast of challenging pixels that were otherwise indistinguishable, (2) a boundary refinement method to effectively improve segmentation accuracy at vessel borders based on Canny edge detection, and (3) a content-aware region-of-interests (ROI) adjustment method to automatically determine the locations and sizes of ROIs which contain ambiguous pixels and demand further verification. Extensive evaluation of our method is conducted on both 2D and 3D datasets. On a public 2D retinal dataset (named DRIVE (Staal 2004 IEEE Trans. Med. Imaging 23 501- 9)) and our 2D clinical cerebral dataset, our approach achieves superior performance to the state-of-the-art methods including a vesselness based method (Frangi 1998 Int. Conf. on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention) and an optimally oriented flux (OOF) based method (Law and Chung 2008 European Conf. on Computer Vision). An evaluation on 11 clinical 3D CTA cerebral datasets shows that our method can achieve 94% average accuracy with respect to the manual segmentation reference, which is 23% to 33% better than the five baseline methods (Yushkevich 2006 Neuroimage 31 1116-28; Law and Chung 2008 European Conf. on Computer Vision; Law and Chung 2009 IEEE Trans.

Experimental results on 10 patients' data, with two 3D CT scans per patient, show that our system's automatic diagnosis outcomes are consistent with clinicians' manual measurements.

"The present study was conducted to assess the possible risks induced by construction of Gavi Dam in Ilam Province; western part of Iran, using MIKE-11 model and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution. For this purpose, vulnerable zone of the dam site against the flooding risk of Gavi River was calculated for different return periods. The flooding zones were stimulated by MIKE-11 model. In order to check whether or not the dam construction could affect the quality of the Gavi River, the physicochemical quality of the river water was also tested. Afterwards, a questionnaire was prepared containing an inventory of possible risks supposed to be induced by construction of Gavi Dam. The questionnaires were placed at disposal of experts to score the items based on their importance. The questionnaires were then analyzed using SPSS Software, version 16. According to which, a total number of 12 risk factors were identified. The dam construction risks were qualitatively assessed by preliminary hazard analysis. Based on the results, 3 of 12 identified risks were recognized unacceptable. The shortlisted risks were prioritized at final step using technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution. Habitat fragmentation with a weight of 0.3002, water pollution with a weight of 0.295, and impacts on aquatics with a weight of 0.293 were identified as three top priority flooding risks. Among the most important corrective measures for mitigation of the risks at construction phase can be pointed to restoration of the land cover, conservation of areas surrounding the dam as a new wildlife habitat, prevention of water contamination, and conservation of fish spawning sites.

"The investigation on antimicrobial mechanisms is a challenging and crucial issue in the fields of food or clinical microbiology, as it constitutes a prerequisite to the development of new antimicrobial processes or compounds, as well as to anticipate phenomenon of microbial resistance. Nowadays it is accepted that a cells population exposed to a stress can cause the appearance of different cell populations and in particular sub-lethally compromised cells which could be defined as viable but non-culturable (VBNC). Recent advances on flow cytometry (FCM) and especially on multi-parameter flow cytometry (MP-FCM) provide the opportunity to obtain high-speed information at real time on damage at single-cell level. This review gathers MP-FCM methodologies based on individual and simultaneous staining of microbial cells employed to investigate their physiological state following different physical and chemical antimicrobial treatments. Special attention will be paid to recent studies exploiting the possibility to corroborate MP-FCM results with additional techniques (plate counting, microscopy, spectroscopy, molecular biology techniques, membrane modeling) in order to elucidate the antimicrobial mechanism of action of a given antimicrobial treatment or compound. The combination of MP-FCM methodologies with these additional methods is namely a promising and increasingly used approach to give further insight in differences in microbial sub-population evolutions in response to antimicrobial treatments.

"In social groups, individuals are often confronted with evaluations of their behaviour by other group members and are motivated to adapt their own behaviour accordingly. In two studies we examine emotional responses towards, and perceived coping abilities with, morality vs. competence evaluations individuals receive from other in-group members. In Study 1, we show that evaluations of one's immoral behaviour primarily induce guilt, whereas evaluations of incompetent behaviour raise anger. In Study 2, we elaborate on the psychological process associated with these emotional responses, and demonstrate that evaluations of immorality, compared to incompetence, diminish group members' perceived coping abilities, which in turn intensifies feelings of guilt. However, when anticipating an opportunity to restore one's self-image as a moral group member, perceived coping abilities are increased and the experience of guilt is alleviated. Together these studies demonstrate how group members can overcome their moral misery when restoring their self-image.

Principal objective of the study is to compare two different types of down jackets with respect to their effect on core body temperature during physical activity and inactivity. Both jackets were filled with different lining, one with chemically modified down called QuixDown (QD), the other one with conventional down (CD). A climatic chamber test with two activity sessions and a break in between was performed. Subjects were physically active on a bike ergometer at moderate level. A total of n = 26 (12m, 14f) healthy and physically active subjects between 18 and 35 years of age were randomly divided into control (CG) and treatment group (TG). TG was equipped with the QD, control group with the CD jacket. To ensure identical loading intensity for the test the individual anaerobic threshold of each subject had been determined in a pretest. Each person was equipped with an in-ear thermometer for measuring the core body temperature at the acoustic meatus. With QD jacket the subject's core body temperature dropped less during the break between both activity sessions than when wearing the CD jacket (p < 0.05, omega(2) = 0.124). No statistical significance could be shown in gender (p = 0.22, omega(2) = 0.02) and interaction jacket/gender (p = 0.56, omega(2) approximate to 0). The chemically modified down insulation seems to offer better thermal insulation than conventional down. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"A rapid prototyping methodology for digital controllers is presented in this paper. Its main application is in the development, debugging, and test of microgrid inverter controllers. To fulfill the application requirements, these systems are characterized by complex multilayer architectures, extending from pulse width modulation (PWM) and current control loops up to global optimization and high level communication functions. The complexity and the wide variability of the different layer implementations make digital control mandatory. However, developing so complex digital controllers on conventional hardware platforms, like digital signal processors (DSPs) or even FPGAs, is not the most practical choice. This paper shows how multiplatform control devices, where software configurable DSP functions and programmable logic circuits are efficiently combined, represent the optimal solution for this field of application. Furthermore, this paper proposes hardware-in-the-loop real-time simulation as an effective means of developing and debugging complex hardware and software codesigned controllers. A case study is presented and used to illustrate the different design and test phases, from initial concept and numerical simulation to final experimental verification.

"Social stress modifies the activity of brain areas involved in the rewarding effects of psychostimulants, inducing neuroadaptations in the dopaminergic mesolimbic system and modifying the sensitivity of dopamine receptors. In the present study we evaluated the effect of the dopamine D-1-and D-2 -like receptor antagonists (SCH23390 and raclopride, respectively) on the short-time effects of acute social defeat (ASD). Male OF1 mice were socially defeated before each conditioning session of the conditioned place preference (CPP) induced by 1 mg/kg or 25 mg/kg of cocaine plus the corresponding dopamine antagonist. A final experiment was designed to evaluate the effect of the dopamine antagonists on the CPP induced by 3 mg/kg of cocaine with or without a stress experience. Mice exposed to ASD showed an increase in reinstatement of the conditioned reinforcing effects of cocaine that was blocked by all of the dopamine receptor antagonists. Blockade of dopamine D2-like receptors with raclopride specifically prevented the effects of stress without affecting the rewarding properties of cocaine. However, SCH23390 inhibited cocaine-induced preference in the control groups and even induced aversion in defeated mice conditioned with the lower dose of cocaine. Moreover, the lowest dose of SCH23390 blocked the rewarding effects of 3 mg/kg of cocaine-induced CPP. Our results confirm that the dopamine D2 receptor is involved in the short-term effects of ASD on the rewarding effects of cocaine. The dopamine D1 receptor is clearly involved in the rewarding effects of cocaine, but its role in the effects of ASD remains to be demonstrated.

"The success of pervasive smart environments lies in the capacity to involve visitors to interact with them. It is essential for retail stores. In this paper we describe the setting-up of a low cost system for the indoor localization and customer interaction, developed with a complex infrastructure of wireless embedded sensors. The creation of a responsive store allows customers to connect the real world to their smart devices and will overcome the lack of ubiquity in public spaces; furthermore, from in-venue analytics and proximity sensor it is possible to customize the user experience. First of all we describe the whole sensor network. We go in deep into the active beacon technology adopted for this study. Then, thanks to the analytics, we present a data evaluation with the aim of determining the best sensor arrangement, according to several user tests. Beside the strong enhancement of human interaction, the results of our essay demonstrate how embedded localization systems could be a useful source for data collection beside the strong enhancement of human interaction. This paper is focused to help retailers and insiders for many purposes such as products development or improvement, segmentation strategies and human behaviour analyses into such stores where the embedded computing augment the environment.

"Confined impinging jets (CIJs) are highly efficient mixers. The scales of mixing in CIJs are controlled by the opposed jets interaction. A mechanistic model is described here, which accurately predicts the impinging position of the opposed jets for a large range of flow rate ratios. The impinging point position is shown to impact the dynamic properties of the flow and the achieved mixing quality. The opposed jets kinetic energy ratio is shown to have a critical impact on mixing, similar to the Reynolds number. A mixing chamber design relation is proposed and verified for the opposed injectors diameters ratio, d(1)/d(2), which enables to operate CIJs under optimum mixing conditions for large ranges of flow rate ratios, viscosity and density ratios between the opposed streams. Optimum d(1)/d(2) values have asymptotes for large and small Reynolds number depending on the process stoichiometry viscosity, and density ratios of the opposed jet streams.

"Heterotrimeric G proteins signal at a variety of endomembrane locations, in addition to their canonical function at the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane (PM), where they are activated by cell surface G protein-coupled receptors. Here we focus on signaling at the Golgi, where activates a signaling cascade, ultimately resulting in vesicle fission from the trans-Golgi network (TGN). To develop a novel molecular tool for inhibiting endogenous in a spatial-temporal manner, we take advantage of a lipid association mutant of the widely used inhibitor GRK2ct (GRK2ct-KERE) and the FRB/FKBP heterodimerization system. We show that GRK2ct-KERE cannot inhibit function when expressed in cells, but recruitment to a specific membrane location recovers the ability of GRK2ct-KERE to inhibit signaling. PM-recruited GRK2ct-KERE inhibits lysophosphatidic acid-induced phosphorylation of Akt, whereas Golgi-recruited GRK2ct-KERE inhibits cargo transport from the TGN to the PM. Moreover, we show that Golgi-recruited GRK2ct-KERE inhibits model basolaterally targeted but not apically targeted cargo delivery, for both PM-destined and secretory cargo, providing the first evidence of selectivity in terms of cargo transport regulated by . Last, we show that Golgi fragmentation induced by ilimaquinone and nocodazole is blocked by inhibition, demonstrating that is a key regulator of multiple pathways that impact Golgi morphology. Thus, we have developed a new molecular tool, recruitable GRK2ct-KERE, to modulate signaling at specific subcellular locations, and we demonstrate novel cargo selectivity for regulation of TGN to PM transport and a novel role for in mediating Golgi fragmentation.

"Utility sector reform spread across the developing world in the 1980s and 1990s. In Egypt, as in many cases, the pace and nature of reform has been challenged by a state-owned national incumbent. However, in the Egyptian telecommunications sector, rapid growth in the cellular market has overtaken the archaic fixed-line system. Hence, the national monopoly provider, Telecom Egypt (TE), has been stripped of its market power as the market diversified. The implemented public sector reform and privatization placed efficiency pressures on TE resulting in improved outcomes for a range of stakeholders, consumers, workers, and the government, including reduced prices, increased access, and improved service quality. This experience offers lessons for policy makers and researchers about liberalization in the face of entrenched state interests. However, there are nuances in the findings relating to market type, that is, fixed-line versus cellular, residential versus non-residential, and national versus international. Despite attempted improvements, direct competition in its retail market has led to deterioration in TE's financial performance, although this has been partially offset by its monopoly supply of an essential input and a degree of protection provided by the regulator sympathetic to TE. The evidence from this case study supports the concept of a staggered introduction of competition. However, protecting inefficient market insiders, be it firms or workers, is always at the expense of potentially more efficient outsiders. (C) 2016 The Author. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"Growing water scarcity and global climate change call for more efficient alternatives of water conservation; rainwater harvesting (RWH) is the most promising alternative among others. However, the assessment of RWH potential and the selection of suitable sites for RWH structures are very challenging for the water managers, especially on larger scales. This study addresses this challenge by presenting a fairly robust methodology for evaluating RWH potential and identifying sites/zones for different RWH structures using geospatial and multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) techniques. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using a case study. The remote sensing data and conventional field data were used to prepare desired thematic layers using ArcGIS(C) software. Distributed Curve Number method was used to calculate event-based runoffs, based on which annual runoff potential and runoff coefficient maps were generated in the GIS (geographic information system) environment. Thematic layers such as slope, drainage density, and runoff coefficient and their features were assigned suitable weights and then they were integrated in a GIS to generate a RWH potential map of the study area. Zones suitable for different RWH structures were also identified, together with suitable sites for constructing recharge structures (check dams and percolation tanks along the streams). It was found that the study area can be classified into three RWH potential zones: (a) 'good' (241 km(2)), (b) 'moderate' (476 km(2)), and (c) 'poor' (287 km(2)). About 3% of the study area (30 km(2)) is suitable for constructing farm ponds, while percolation tanks (on the ground) can be constructed in about 2.7% of the area (27 km(2)). Of the 83 sites identified for the recharge structures, 32 recharge sites are specially suited to the inhabitants because of their proximity. It is concluded that the integrated geospatial and MCDA techniques offer a useful and powerful tool for the planning of rainwater harvesting at a basin or sub-basin scale. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

"The effects of five towns on river water pollution were examined along the Lyna River (southern watershed of the Baltic Sea, northern Poland). The relationships among the spatially derived indicators of urbanization, environmental variables, and physicochemical and microbiological data (heterotrophic plate count at 22 and 37 degrees C, and fecal coli) obtained from longitudinal river profiling have been examined with the use of multivariate analyses such as principal component analysis with factor analysis (PCA/FA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). We recognized the river channel as an environmental path that links serial urban areas into an urban river continuum. An overall increasing trend in nutrients and indicator bacteria from suburban headwaters to urbanized sections of the river was detected despite a significant decrease in those between the towns. We concluded that the role of a multicity is equally as important as a single urban area in predicting the impacts of man-made pollutants on river water quality.

"This paper proposes a gravity heat pipe exchanger used for cooling the communication base station to replace the traditional air conditioning system during winter and transition seasons. Tests were conducted on a commercial available gravity heat pipe exchanger. The experiment was performed to study the effects of the air flow rate and temperature on the cooling capacity, the heat transfer unit number (NTU) and cooling efficiency of the heat pipe exchanger. The results showed that the larger the air flow rate, the smaller the NTU and the larger the cooling capacity. Based on the analysis of the experimental data, it proved that the gravity heat pipe exchanger could reduce running time and operating cost of air conditioning system. According to the practical applications, the yearly cooling loads of a typical communication base station were further calculated for five typical cities which represent the five climatic zones of China. The results validated that the energy saving by using the gravity heat pipe exchanger is significant. The highest annual electricity-saving rate is achieved by Kunming, about 48.6%, while the lowest annual electricity-saving rate is obtained in Guangzhou, about 18.7% among the five climatic zones. The fitted correlation of cooling capacity in term of outdoor temperature is generic to evaluate approximately the performance of applying the gravity heat pipe exchanger in the actual applications subject to various outdoor temperatures.

"Syrian conflict and oppression caused extreme suffering for Syrians. They threatened the existence of Syrian identity and Syria's territorial integrity. They caused more than half of Syria's population to be internally displaced or become refugees. The goal of the current study was to assess the physical and mental health toll of Syrian experience, an intergroup trauma, on Syrians as individuals. A sample of 195 internally displaced and 111 Syrian refugees in the Nederland was administered measures of oppressive Syrian experience (SOE), cumulative stress and trauma, posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD), postcumulative stress and trauma disorders (complex PTSD), and existential annihilation anxiety (EAA). Descriptive statistics showed high rates of PTSD, comorbidities, and suicidality. Internally displaced had significantly higher morbidity rates than refugees. Using path analysis, we tested a model where SOE, mediated by other interpersonal traumas, triggered EAA and affected severely their mental and physical health. The model fitted well. We tested the model's structural invariance across genders and the 2 groups. While the model was configurally and metrically (conceptually) invariant across groups, it was not strongly or strictly invariant. We examined the dynamics behind their similarities and differences. We discussed the need to resolve the conflict and develop evidence-based interventions to help relieve their suffering.

"Recent work has suggested the presence of a variety of motives and mechanisms that affect young children's sharing decisions. Yet, little is known about the relative impact of these motives. In three experiments with 3- to 6-year-old children (total N=140), the current study contrasts two important recipient characteristics that have been suggested to play a major role in early sharing; the positive social relationship between children and recipients and the differences in recipients' wealth. To this end, children could allocate resources to a friend who already possessed a lot of them and to a nonfriend (Experiments 1 and 2) or a stranger (Experiment 3) who owned only very few resources. Across age, children showed a preference to share more with their rich friend, although this tendency was stronger in the older preschool children. The findings are discussed with respect to theoretical accounts on the psychological basis of early sharing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

"The magnetic damper was introduced into the high speed rotating machinery to restrain the vibration of the rotor supported by active magnetic bearings. The experimental setup, which was made up of one rotor, two radial active magnetic bearings, one axial active magnetic bearing, one magnetic damper and control system, was built to investigate the effects of the magnetic damper locations on dynamic characteristics of the system by theoretical analysis, experimental modal analysis and actual operation of the system. The results show that the vibration of the active magnetic bearing system operating at the modal frequency can be reduced more effectively if the magnetic damper is located far from the nodes of the corresponding mode shape.

"This paper accepts the widespread view that as electricity generation systems transition towards a greater proportion of renewables provision, there will be an increasing need for storage facilities. However, it differs from most such studies in contrasting the private incentives of a storage operator with the public desirability of bulk storage. A key factor in the context of a market such as Britain, where renewable energy largely means wind generation, is the nature of wind generation itself. The problem of wind's high variance and intermittent nature is explored. It is argued that not only is there a missing money and a missing market issue in providing secure energy supplies, there is also a missing informational issue. A key opportunity for new storage is participation in a capacity market, if the setting is right.

"Shoreline monitoring is essential for integrated coastal zone management (ICZM). It provides the necessary information needed to manage the settlement of coastal areas, establishes guidelines for management of socioeconomic activities within the coastal areas, provides information necessary for recovery actions of beach regeneration, and provides a reference baseline for studies related to climate change in coastal zones. Shoreline monitoring methods are largely dependent on goals, costs, implementation, and applicability. For monitoring of short coastal shorelines (e.g., tens to hundreds of kilometers), global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based methods are emerging as low-cost approaches that offer rapid, weather-independent, and quickly updatable products that could benefit policy makers when high costs of traditional methods, such as photogrammetry and remote sensing, are of concern. However, various GNSS methods applicable to shoreline monitoring exist, making it difficult for decision makers to choose a suitable approach. Using a case study of the Pernambuco State ICZM in Brazil, this study evaluates three of the most commonly used GNSS-based shoreline monitoring methods, that is, relative kinematic (RK), real-time kinematic (RTK), and precise point positioning (PPP) methods. It also provides a comprehensive analysis of their strengths and limitations. The results highlight the issues and important considerations in choosing an economically viable GNSS method for mapping shoreline changes, particularly for supporting ICZM policies.

"With introducing demand response aggregator (DRA) in smart paradigm, small customers can actively participate in price and incentive-based demand response programs. This new matter can significantly affect many factors of power system such as transmission network security. Accordingly, it is notably useful to define an adjusted framework for transmission expansion planning in smart environment. A long-term market simulation is performed using a tri-level iterative framework to find the best expansion decisions for transmission company (TransCo) in a pool-based market. The TransCo's investment decisions are made by a merchant approach consistent with transmission network security and smart environment. The effects of smart environment on future network configuration, strategic bidding of generators in the market operation, and contingency analysis are considered during planning process. The effectiveness of proposed method is examined on the IEEE 24-bus system with one DRA, one TransCo, and two generation companies under the independent system operator's supervision.

"AimIt has been reported that many people with dementia require hospitalizations. The objective of the present study was to determine predictive factors for hospitalizations in people with dementia. MethodsA total of 70 individuals with dementia living in a veterans' home in southern Taiwan were consecutively enrolled. During prospective follow up, all hospitalization events were recorded. ResultsThe mean age of residents with dementia was 86.14.0years, and the mean follow-up time for this population was 2.2 +/- 1.1years. Among individuals, 62.9% suffered from malnutrition or were at risk of malnutrition (minimal nutritional assessment-short form score 11), and 8.6% of individuals had a body mass index of <18.5Kg/m(2). There were 52 (74.3%) individuals who had previously fallen. Overall, 51 of 70 residents were hospitalized during the follow-up period. In those individuals with previous falls, there was a significantly increased risk of hospitalization (odds ratio 5.61, 95% CI 1.18-26.7). Furthermore, three factors were significantly associated with the risk of fall, including handgrip strength, malnutrition and Mini-Mental State Examination score. ConclusionsThe results of the present study showed that hospitalization was a frequent event in residents with dementia living in a long-term care facility. The major predictor for hospital admission was history of a previous fall. Screening those with dementia for history of injurious falls and associated risk factors for falling could help identify those at risk of hospitalization, thus necessitating a comprehensive intervention to reduce hospitalization.

"Rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems have the unique ability to contribute to stormwater management goals via mitigation of runoff volumes and peak flow rates. Additionally, collecting and storing runoff via RWH systems can potentially provide water quality benefits due to physical and chemical processes that occur within the storage tank. This study quantified the water quality improvement provided by storing rooftop runoff via RWH systems at four sites in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA. Roof runoff and extraction spigot samples were analyzed for total suspended solids (TSS), nitrogen species and total phosphorus. Roof concentrations were significantly greater than spigot concentrations for all constituents except TSS, indicating the ability of RWH systems to significantly lower nutrient concentrations of incoming roof runoff. Lack of significant TSS reduction was likely attributable to low, 'irreducible' concentrations of TSS in the roof runoff. The use of additional filtration components prior to the extraction spigot could aid in lowering spigot TSS concentrations. The findings presented herein contend that stormwater benefits associated with RWH are not only limited to hydrologic mitigation, but also include reductions in concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus species. Thus, it is recommended that pollutant removal credit be assigned to these systems when used as stormwater control measures.

"Milling is a crucial step in producing restorations using computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) systems. In this study the trueness of currently available milling devices was evaluated. Thirty clinical cases (ten inlays, ten crowns, ten onlays) were milled from ceramic blocks using four different milling approaches: five axis with IMES CORiTEC 450i, four axis with CEREC MCXL, four axis with CEREC MCXL-EF and five axis with inLab MCX5. The milled restorations were scanned and the occlusal and inner surfaces compared to the originally calculated 3D surface using difference analysis software. The (90-10 %) / 2 percentile of the distances were calculated and analysed using one-way ANOVA with the post hoc Scheff, test (alpha = 0.05). Chipping of marginal areas were visually examined and analysed using one-way ANOVA with a post hoc Tamhane test (alpha = 0.05). At inner surfaces, the milling trueness of IMES (33.9 +/- 16.3 mu m), X5 (32.3 +/- 9.7 mu m) and MCXL-EF (34.4 +/- 7.5 mu m) was significantly better (p < 0.001) than that of MCXL (62.1 +/- 17.1 mu m). At occlusal surfaces, MCXL-EF (25.7 +/- 9.3 mu m) showed significant higher accuracy (p < 0.001) than MCXL (48.7 +/- 23.3 mu m) and X5 (40.9 +/- 20.4 mu m). IMES produced the most chipping (p < 0.001). Five-axis milling devices yield high trueness. MCXL-EF is competitive and may allow chairside fabrication with good milling results. Accurate milling is required for well-fitting restorations and thereby requires fewer manual finishing steps, yields smaller marginal gaps, resistance to secondary caries and longevity of restorations.

"The feedback on the use of submerged structures for beach protection is still scarce, and the shoreline response to structures is still poorly understood at present. Most of the studies presents structures close to the shoreline without significant morphologies on the shoreface that could interact with it. On the Lido of Sete, a narrow coastal barrier facing the Mediterranean Sea, an experimentation of beach protection using a submerged geotextile structure is undertaken. The structure was deployed in 2013, and to analyse nearshore dynamics, an ARGUS video system was installed in 2011. Video-derived shoreline, bar crest position, alongshore currents, swash processes, were used to assess the natural dynamics and to evaluate the evolution after the installation of the 850 m long structure. The monitoring permitted to describe a rapid dynamics of crescentic nearshore bars. Processes of longshore migration, linearization, as well as a strong coupling between bar dynamics and shoreline sinuosities were described. After the deployment of the geotextile, a progressive linearization and rotation of the nearshore bar (parallel to the tube) was observed. This process induced a progressive rotation of the shoreline and an important beach enlargement. The 3D patterns, both in the bar and emerged beach progressively disappeared. With this new beach morphology, storm run-up is more regular alongshore, and only major events can reach the dune front and generate impacts. This field experiment provide an interesting feedback on morphological response following the deployment of a submerged structure on a shoreface characterized by an important nearshore bar dynamics.

"Background: Functionalized nanoparticles (NPs) are one promising tool for detecting specific molecular targets and combine molecular biology and nanotechnology aiming at modern imaging. We aimed at ligand-directed delivery with a suitable target-biomarker to detect early pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Promising targets are galectins (Gal), due to their strong expression in and on PDAC-cells and occurrence at early stages in cancer precursor lesions, but not in adjacent normal tissues. Results: Molecular probes (10-29 AA long peptides) derived from human tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) were selected as binding partners to galectins. Affinity constants between the synthesized t-PA peptides and Gal were determined by microscale thermophoresis. The 29 AA-long t-PA-peptide-1 with a lactose-functionalized serine revealed the strongest binding properties to Gal-1 which was 25-fold higher in comparison with the native t-PA protein and showed additional strong binding to Gal-3 and Gal-4, both also over-expressed in PDAC. t-PA-peptide-1 was selected as vector moiety and linked covalently onto the surface of biodegradable iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs). In particular, CAN-doped maghemite NPs (CAN-Mag), promising as contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), were selected as magnetic core and coated with different biocompatible polymers, such as chitosan (CAN-Mag-Chitosan NPs) or polylactic co glycolic acid (PLGA) obtaining polymeric nanoparticles (CAN-Mag@PNPs), already approved for drug delivery applications. The binding efficacy of t-PA-vectorized NPs determined by exposure to different pancreatic cell lines was up to 90%, as assessed by flow cytometry. The in vivo targeting and imaging efficacy of the vectorized NPs were evaluated by applying murine pancreatic tumor models and assessed by 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The t-PA-vectorized NPs as well as the protease-activated NPs with outer shell decoration (CAN-Mag@PNPs-PEG-REGAcp-PEG/tPA-pep1Lac) showed clearly detectable drop of subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor staining-intensity indicating a considerable uptake of the injected NPs. Post mortem NP deposition in tumors and organs was confirmed by Fe staining of histopathology tissue sections. Conclusions: The targeted NPs indicate a fast and enhanced deposition of NPs in the murine tumor models. The CAN-Mag@PNPs-PEG-REGAcp-PEG/tPA-pep1Lac interlocking steps strategy of NPs delivery and deposition in pancreatic tumor is promising.

"In this paper, we introduce a simple; but an effective algorithm to detect and image the precise location of moving targets behind obstacles based on one-transmitter and two-receiver configuration. The problem geometry together with the formulation details of the algorithm are given. The performance of the algorithm is first evaluated by synthesizing a numerical scenario that is simulated by moving ideal scatterers. Then, the success and the validity of the algorithm are being assessed by an error analysis study that calculates the error associated by the approximations. The algorithm is tested with measured data obtained by an experimental set-up for detecting a human movement behind the wall. Resultant two-dimensional consecutive images indicate that this algorithm can be effectively used for pinpointing the moving targets in TWR or similar through-the-obstacle radar applications with good fidelity.

"Estuary plumes on the western Louisiana continental shelf in the Gulf of Mexico, outside of constricted channels of the Sabine and Calcasieu Lakes were observed on two RADARSAT-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The in situ data showed a change in salinity of similar to 2-3 PSUs across the front on the northwest edge of the plume, corresponding to locations of vertical salinity variation of 5.5-7.5 PSU. Velocity magnitude outside of the inlet reached more than 2.3 ms(-1) seaward and a brackish lens in the upper 4.5 m of the water column, the spread of which contributed to the development of a plume. The volume of brackish water within the plume was estimated an order of magnitude larger than the volume output from the Calcasieu River within an entire ebb tidal period. This implies that the plume was formed during multiple tidal cycles and it sustained during the flood tides because only weak diurnal tides exist. Both satellite and in situ observations showed an interesting western intensification of the plume. An analysis to the momentum/vorticity equations suggests that the western intensification is due to the asymmetry of the vorticity-divergence relationship under the Coriolis force. This can also be enhanced by an ambient coastal current that strengthens the convergence at the front. Estuary plumes are shown as bright and dark features in two SAR images. Results from a radar model simulation and in situ water temperature data showed that the SAR observed plume features were dominated by the water temperature differences.

"Existing theories of empathic response to visual art works postulate the primacy of automatic embodied reaction to images based on mirror neuron mechanisms. Arguing for a more inclusive concept of empathy-related response and integrating four distinct bodies of literature, we discuss contextual, and personal factors which modulate empathic response to depicted people. We then present an integrative model of empathy-related responses to depicted people in art works. The model assumes that a response to empathy-eliciting figural artworks engages the dynamic interaction of two mutually interlinked sets of processes: socio-affective/cognitive processing, related to the person perception, and esthetic processing, primarily concerned with esthetic appreciation and judgment and attention to non-social aspects of the image. The model predicts that the specific pattern of interaction between empathy-related and esthetic processing is co-determined by several sets of factors: (i) the viewer's individual characteristics, (ii) the context variables (which include various modes of priming by narratives and other images), (iii) multidimensional features of the image, and (iv) aspects of a viewer's response. Finally we propose that the model is implemented by the interaction of functionally connected brain networks involved in socio-cognitive and esthetic processing.

"We examined the extent to which the arginine vasopressin receptor 1a (AVPR1a) and dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) were related to sensitive maternal behavior directly or indirectly via maternal social cognition. Participants were 207 (105 European-American and 102 African-American) mothers and their children (52% females). Sensitive maternal behavior was rated and aggregated across a series of tasks when infants were 6 months, 1 year and 2 years old. At 6 months, mothers were interviewed about their empathy, attributions about infant behavior and beliefs about crying to assess their parenting-related social cognition. Mothers with long alleles for AVPR1a and DRD4 engaged in more mother-oriented social cognition (i.e. negative attributions and beliefs about their infants' crying, beta = 0.13, P < 0.05 and beta = 0.16, P < 0.05, respectively), which in turn predicted less sensitive maternal behavior (beta = -0.23, P < 0.01). Both indirect effects were statistically significant independent of one another and covariates [95% confidence interval (CI): -0.22, -0.03 and beta = -0.03 for AVPR; 95% CI: -0.20, -0.03 and beta = -0.04 for DRD4]. There were no significant direct effects of AVPR1a or DRD4 on maternal sensitivity (beta = 0.02, P = .73 and beta = -0.10, P = .57, respectively). The results did not vary for African-American and European-American mothers (Delta chi(2) = 18.76, Delta df = 16, P = 0.28). Results support the view that one mechanism by which maternal genes are associated with parental behavior is via social cognition.

"Reinforcements can change the mechanical characteristics and liquefaction resistance of soils. The main purpose of this study is to realise the behaviour of static liquefaction of saturated silty sand reinforced by different arrangements of geotextile layers. Several series of undrained triaxial tests were conducted on reinforced and unreinforced saturated sand and sand mixed with varying amounts of silt (0-50%). Factors such as the silt content, arrangement and number of geotextile layers are discussed in this paper. The results indicate that by increasing the silt content up to about 35%, the static liquefaction resistance decreases in reinforced and unreinforced silty sand. With further increases in silt content from 35 to 50%, the liquefaction resistance increases. Also, it was found that geotextile inclusion increases the liquefaction resistance of saturated sand for all silt contents examined. The results of this study are limited to the use of sand and silty sand reinforced with one type of nonwoven geotextile.

"Background: Most particulate matter (PM) and health studies in children with asthma use exposures averaged over the course of a day and do not take into account spatial/temporal variability that presumably occurs as children move from home, into transit and then school microenvironments. The objectives of this work were to identify increases in morning PM exposure occurring within home, transit and school microenvironments and determine their associations with asthma-related inflammation and rescue medication use. Methods: In 2007-2008, thirty Denver-area schoolchildren with asthma performed personal PM exposure monitoring using a real-time sensor integrated with a geographic information system (GIS) to apportion exposures to home, transit and school microenvironments. Concurrently, daily monitoring of the airway inflammatory biomarker urinary leukotriene E4 (uLTE(4)) and albuterol usage was performed. Results: Mean PM exposures each morning were relatively well correlated between microenvironments for subject samples (0.3 < r < 0.8), thus limiting use of this exposure metric to attribute health effects to PM exposure in specific microenvironments. Within-microenvironment increases in exposure, such as would be characterized by one or a series of transient spikes or a sustained increase in concentration (exposure event), however, were not strongly correlated between microenvironments (vertical bar r vertical bar= 5 mu g/m(3) exposure event during transit, they demonstrated a 24.0 % increase in uLTE(4) (95 % CI: 1.5 %, 51.5 %) and a 9.7 % (-5.9 %, 27.9 %) increase in albuterol usage compared to days without transit exposure events. Associations between exposure events and health outcomes in home and school microenvironments tended to be positive as well, but weaker than for transit. Conclusions: School children with asthma moving across morning microenvironments experience spatially heterogeneous PM exposures with potentially varying health effects.

"Recent years have seen a growing interest in more distributed approaches towards stormwater management, often integrated with other forms of distributed management of urban water such as water demand management technologies. This paper focuses on the role of green roofs (GR), rainwater harvesting (RWH) and greywater reuse and their integration at the building level. A number of models were developed to simulate these systems, and provide design curves able to simultaneously minimise both total runoff volumes and the amount of potable water used in the building (for irrigation and toilet flushing). The models developed were applied to the design of stormwater infrastructure for the building of the National Gallery, in Athens, Greece. A sensitivity analysis of various model parameters was conducted, with results suggesting, inter alia: (i) a significant decrease of total runoff volumes for rainfalls of medium-to-small return periods; (ii) a significant influence of the plant factor on water requirements (with implications for selecting vegetation for GR in a Mediterranean climate); and (iii) a significant impact of latent heat peaking during the months of June and July. The trade-off, on runoff volumes, between percentage of green roof area and the dimensions of the water storage tank was also investigated. The results suggest that the most preferable solution for conserving potable water was RWH combined with greywater recycling, while for runoff minimisation the best option was the combination of green roof and greywater recycling.

"Studied the effects of female migrants' acculturation strategies on affective evaluation, sexism and social dominance orientation - SDO in France, as a host country, and Romania, as a home country. The same quasi-experimental design was used in both countries: the description of an integrated, assimilated, separated or marginalized female migrant was introduced to participants and then benevolent and hostile sexism, SDO and the degree of acceptance of the migrant were assessed. A control condition was introduced for assessing these attitudes without migrant description. In France, the female migrant was perceived more positively in the integration condition than in the three other ones while assimilation increased SDO. In Romania, the female migrant was perceived more positively and the benevolent sexism was lower when the home culture was maintained than when it was not. Considering that female migrants strategies depend on the acculturation policies of host countries, these results highlight the role of integration policies for improving female migrants' acceptation, relations between communities and relations between genders. This study contributes to the extant literature through two main innovations: 1/it provides information on the influence of female migrants' acculturation strategies on gender relations and SDO, and 2/it documents this influence in a host and a home country using a similar procedure.

"Purpose: A subgroup of individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN) displays social difficulties; however, it is not clear if individuals with comorbid autism spectrum disorders account for these difficulties. Methods: We compared social function using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule in 43 young females with first-episode AN who did not have comorbid autism spectrum disorder, 28 individuals recovered from adolescent-onset AN, and 41 healthy comparison individuals (age range 14-22 years). We measured adaptive behavior with the Vineland-II parent questionnaire, and aspects of social cognition with psychological tests, such as the Reading-the-Mind-in-the-Eyes test, Profile of Nonverbal Sensitivity short version, The Awareness of Social Inference Test, Animated Triangles, and the CANTAB Affective Go/No-go task. Results: Participants with first-episode AN and those recovered from AN displayed difficulties in social function, which were not associated with body mass index or other state factors of the disorder in those with first-episode AN. Mood problems and anxiety were not associated with these difficulties. Parents rated participants with first-episode AN lower than recovered and control participants on the Socialization Domain of Vineland-II. Finally, only participants recovered from AN demonstrated deficits in specific domains of social cognition: perceiving nonverbal bodily gesture and vocal prosody. Conclusions: Young females with first-episode AN and those recovered from AN displayed impairments in social function, which may represent more stable traits of the disorder. Only participants recovered from AN demonstrated deficits in social cognition. (C) 2016 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved.

"In recent years there has been increased interest in understanding cognitive processes that playa role in the pathogenesis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). One cognitive factor that has received little attention is rumination. Rumination, defined as the tendency to repetitively analyze ones problems and feelings of distress, has been implicated in the development and maintenance of several mood and anxiety-related disorders. Thus, the primary aim of the current study was to examine the role of rumination in OCD symptoms using an unselected treatment-seeking sample (N = 105). Multiple regression analyses revealed a significant association between rumination and the unacceptable thoughts/neutralizing domain of OCD. These findings remained significant even after accounting for a relevant and related construct, in particular negative affect. These findings support a growing body of literature establishing rumination as a transdiagnostic risk factor. Further clinical and experimental research is needed to confirm these findings and expand our knowledge of metacognitive models of OCD. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"Objective We aimed to identify the association of carotid atherosclerosis with the traditional risk factors, disease features, cytokine profile, and calprotectin in patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS). Methods 63 primary pSS patients and 63 age- and sex-matched healthy controls underwent carotid ultrasound, clinical and laboratory examination. The presence of carotid plaques was taken as carotid atherosclerosis. The covariates of carotid atherosclerosis were identified in univariate and multivariate regressions. Results Patients with pSS had higher prevalence of carotid atherosclerosis (13% vs. 2%, p0.05). In univariate analyses, serum calprotectin, most traditional cardiovascular (age, male sex, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, hypertriglyceridaemia, and serum creatinine), and some disease-associated risk factors (glucocorticoid or saliva substitute use, constitutional domain of Enlar-Sjogren's syndrome disease activity index - EULAR) were associated with a higher risk for plaque. In a multivariate analysis, having pSS and higher serum calprotectin were associated with carotid atherosclerosis independent of traditional risk factors. Conclusion pSS have a higher prevalence of carotid atherosclerosis, which is associated with higher serum calprotectin level independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Our findings suggest calprotectin as a biomarker of subclinical atherosclerosis in pSS.

"Previous studies exploring the link between social status and behavior have predominantly utilized measures that do not provide information regarding toward whom aggression or prosocial behavior is directed. Using a contextualized target-specific approach, this study examined whether high-and low-status adolescents behave differently toward peers of varying levels of status. Participants, aged 11-15 (N = 426, 53 % females), completed measures assessing aggression and prosocial behavior toward each same-sex grademate. A distinct pattern of findings emerged regarding the likeability, popularity, and dominance status of adolescents and their peer targets. Popular adolescents reported more direct aggression, indirect aggression, and prosocial behavior toward popular peers than did unpopular adolescents. Well-accepted adolescents reported more prosocial behavior toward a wider variety of peers than did rejected adolescents. Finally, compared to subordinate adolescents, dominant adolescents reported greater direct and indirect aggression toward dominant than subordinate peers. The results highlight the importance of studying target-specific behavior to better understand the status-behavior link.

"Computer assisted technologies offer new opportunities in medical imaging and rapid prototyping in biomechanical engineering. Three dimensional (3D) modelling of soft tissues and bones are becoming more important. The accuracy of the analysis in modelling processes depends on the outline of the tissues derived from medical images. The aim of this study is the evaluation of the accuracy of 3D models of a dog femur derived from computed tomography data by using point cloud method and boundary line method on several modelling software. Solidworks, Rapidform and 3DSMax software were used to create 3D models and outcomes were evaluated statistically. The most accurate 3D prototype of the dog femur was created with stereolithography method using rapid prototype device. Furthermore, the linearity of the volumes of models was investigated between software and the constructed models. The difference between the software and real models manifests the sensitivity of the software and the devices used in this manner.

"Recently, there are revolutionary achievements in silicon-based conventional terahertz (THz) and millimeter-wave (mm-wave) integrated circuits, particularly with the advancement of CMOS technology. However, unlike Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits (RFICs), innovative designs and lack of various circuit techniques still remain unknown in THz gap. In this paper, a multi-band THz amplifier is presented in 40 nm CMOS technology with adaptive band selection technique. The smart amplifier is able to adjust the band of operation with respect to input signal power and frequency. In addition, the circuit performance will be adjusted to achieve maximum power gain. In order to achieve multi-band external neutralization, self-healing technique is vastly utilized by means of tunable transmission lines (TTLs). The proposed smart system contains tunable transmission lines, a 5-stage amplifier core, two Successive Approximation Register-based analog-to-digital converters (SAR ADCs), a digital control core and two on-chip power sensing blocks. The fabricated amplifier achieves P-1 of 1 dBm, P-sat of 6.1 dBm and power gain of 14.8 dB +/- <1.5 dB from 197 to 288 GHz frequency range. The proposed amplifier demonstrates the highest operation frequency among all published state-of-arts in all CMOS technologies.

"To design electric machines, the motor performance, cost, and manufacturing have to be considered. Hence, researchers have called this the multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem in which the goal is to minimize or maximize several objective functions at the same time. In order to solve the MOO problem, various algorithms, such as nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II and multi-objective particle swarm optimization, have been widely used. When these algorithms are applied to the electric machine design, much time consumption is inevitable due to many times of function evaluations using a finite-element method. To solve this problem, a novel surrogate-assisted MOO algorithm is proposed. Its validity is confirmed by comparing the optimization results of test functions with conventional optimization methods. To verify the feasibility of its application to a practical electric machine, an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor is designed.

"Extensive green-roof systems are expected to have a synergetic effect in mitigating urban runoff, decreasing temperature and supplying water to a building. Mitigation of runoff through rainwater retention requires the effective design of a green-roof catchment. This study identified how to improve building runoff mitigation through quantitative analysis of an extensive green-roof system. Quantitative analysis of green-roof runoff characteristics indicated that the extensive green roof has a high water-retaining capacity response to rainfall of less than 20 mm/h. As the rainfall intensity increased, the water-retaining capacity decreased. The catchment efficiency of an extensive green roof ranged from 0.44 to 0.52, indicating reduced runoff comparing with efficiency of 0.9 for a concrete roof. Therefore, extensive green roofs are an effective storm water best-management practice and the proposed parameters can be applied to an algorithm for rainwater-harvesting tank design.

These solutions depend on the prior knowledge about the reference plane used by the homography. We then demonstrate that the number of matched points can vary from two to three and that a direct closed-form solution or a Grobner basis based solution can be derived according to this plane. Many experimental results on synthetic and real sequences in indoor and outdoor environments show the efficiency and the robustness of our approach compared to standard methods.

"The aggregation of specific proteins plays a pivotal role in the etiopathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). beta-Amyloid (A beta) peptide-containing plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated protein tau are the two main neuropathological lesions in Alzheimer's disease. Meanwhile, Parkinson's disease is defined by the presence of intraneuronal inclusions (Lewy bodies), in which alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) has been identified as a major protein component. The current literature provides considerable insights into the mechanisms underlying oligomericrelated neurodegeneration, as well as the relationship between protein aggregation and ND, thus facilitating the development of novel putative biomarkers and/or pharmacological targets. Recently, alpha-syn, tau and A beta have been shown to interact each other or with other pathological proteins to form toxic heteroaggregates. These latest findings are overcoming the concept that each neurodegenerative disease is related to the misfolding of a single specific protein. In this review, potential opportunities and pharmacological approaches targeting alpha-syn, tau and A beta and their oligomeric forms are highlighted with examples from recent studies. Protein aggregation as a biomarker of NDs, in both the brain and peripheral fluids, is deeply explored. Finally, the relationship between biomarker establishment and assessment and their use as diagnostics or therapeutic targets are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

"Random number generators are essential in modern cryptography. The security of a cryptographic scheme can be achieved under the assumption that the system uses ideal random numbers to produce sensitive security parameters such as encryption keys and initial vectors. The weakness of the random number generator makes the entire cryptographic system insecure. In particular, the lack of entropy sources leads to predictable output random bits so that secret information can be guessed by malicious attackers. Therefore, it is important to collect sufficient entropy from physical noise sources. In this paper, we consider graphics processing units (GPUs) as an entropy source. From the race conditions in the parallel computations on a GPU, we can harvest sufficient entropy for cryptography. Using the entropy estimations in NIST SP 800-90B, the amount of entropy is estimated and compared with other physical sources.

"Pro-environmental behavioural spillover when performing one pro-environmental behaviour (PEB) increases the likelihood of performing another has been identified as a possible way to increase the amount of environmentally friendly behaviours that individuals perform. The current research investigated this spillover process, the role of chronic environmental motivations, goal priming and behavioural similarity. Three studies (two conducted with students and one conducted with the general Australian public) provided evidence to suggest that positive spillover occurs between PEBs that are similar in terms of the resources required to perform them, but not between PEBs that are resource-dissimilar. There was no evidence to suggest that negative spillover (the instance where performing one PEB lessens the likelihood of subsequently performing another) occurred. Chronic environmental striving seems to independently influence the performance of PEBs, especially spending time to be more environmentally friendly. The role of priming goals in the spillover process remains unclear. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"Seepage plays an important role in soil erosion in contour ridge systems. Seepage generated from subsurface flow causes hillslope instability by reducing the soil shear strength and mobilizing soil particles and can produce cavelike features called seepage undercuts that can lead to contour failure. As the main threat to contour plowing, seepage results in large amounts of soil erosion due to row grade. Models used to predict seepage over a time series will provide a basis for modeling soil erosion resulting from seepage in contour ridging systems. Understanding seepage and its effects will advance our knowledge regarding seepage erosion mechanisms in contour ridge systems. In this study, 23 treatments were arranged using an orthogonal rotatable central composite design to model a seepage time series, build a simple seepage prediction model and investigate the effects of row grade, field slope and ridge height on seepage discharge. Most of the seepage discharge time series followed an S-shaped curve. The seepage discharge processes were fit by an exponential model with a determination coefficients (R-2) greater than 0.995. Furthermore, the physical meaning of the exponential model was consistent with the experimental results. The seepage discharge continuously increased before the inflection point and then decreased. Finally, the seepage discharge approached a steady value. The maximum seepage discharge growth rate was achieved within 14 min, and the seepage discharge became steady within 106 min. Second-order polynomial regression models were used to determine the total and predicted steady seepage discharge using independent variables of row grade, field slope and ridge height, which produced R-2 values of 0.66 (p < 0.05) and 0.68 (p < 0.05), respectively. Ridge height and row grade significantly affected (p < 0.05) the total and predicted steady seepage discharge. Field slope (and its related factors) was ignored because it had no significant effects on seepage discharge. The effects of row grade resulted in a concave curve with an increasing factor value, and ridge height exerted a positive linear effect on seepage discharge. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"Oral immunotherapy may offer an alternative to elimination diets in peanut allergy. Of 72 children for whom this treatment was proposed following an oral challenge test (TPO1), 68 agreed and entered a personalised oral immunotherapy study. There were 10 treatment failures and 31 patients underwent a second oral challenge during treatment (TPO2). Cumulative reactogenic dose and clinical severity score were compared. Skin tests and assay of IgE specific for peanut allergy were first performed prior to TPO1 and again during follow-up. The mean age of these 31 patients was 8.1 years. The median time between two challenge tests was 1.4 years. The mean cumulative reactogenic dose between TPO1 (4207 mg of peanut) and TPO2 (8769 mg of peanut) increased significantly (P < 0.001). Conversely, the clinical severity score was significantly reduced between the two challenge tests (P < 0.001). No serious adverse effects were reported during immunotherapy. This treatment in a paediatric population, administered at the patients' homes, confirms the efficacy of the therapy as well as an acceptable benefit/risk ratio consistent with the data.

"Whether people seek help depends on their estimations of both the likelihood and the value of getting it. Although past research has carefully examined how accurately help-seekers predict whether their help requests will be granted, it has failed to examine how accurately help-seekers predict the value of that help, should they receive it. In this paper, we focus on how accurately help-seekers predict a key determinant of help value, namely, helper effort. In four studies, we find that (a) helpers put more effort into helping than help-seekers expect (Studies 1-4); (b) people do not underestimate the effort others will expend in general, but rather only the effort others will expend helping them (Study 2); and (c) this underestimation of help effort stems from help-seekers' failure to appreciate the discomfort in particular, the guilt that helpers would experience if they did not do enough to help (Studies 3 & 4).

"The potential of nanotechnology to make it possible to acquire and manipulate very large sets of data raises fundamental questions about privacy and human dignity. Medical privacy allows a person to withhold their medical records and other information from others, perhaps because of fears that it might affect their insurance coverage or employment, or to avoid the embarrassment caused by revealing medical conditions or treatments. The emerging 'nanoneuroimplants' have given rise to new policy issues. Such developments could be used to achieve greater safety, security and individualized healthcare, and could offer advantages to business (for example in tracking and other monitoring of materials and products). However, the same devices might be used in ways that limit individual or group privacy by covert surveillance, by collecting and distributing personal information (such as health or genetic profiles) without adequate consent, and by concentrating information in the hands of those with the resources to develop and control such networks. The discussions on ethical and societal aspects of nanoneuroimplants tend to focus on how ambient intelligence, also called ubiquitous computing, changes the organization of society and how people communicate and interact with each other. When it is possible to track every citizen, and to store information that would predict patterns of future behavior, it is important to set guidelines for the use of that information early. The development of large commercial databases using current technology is proceeding rapidly; nanoneuroimplants have the capability to accelerate this development in the future. Therefore, privacy is a key value which underpins human dignity. Thus, the objective of this study is primarily to raise awareness and questions concerning the privacy and human dignity dilemmas created by nanoneuroimplants in this rapidly expanding field. Breakthroughs from this research at nanoneuroimplants will therefore have a significant impact on the market for enabling new neural prosthetic-based technologies. Ethical awareness and analysis must take place now in order to ensure an appropriate and timely impact on the various technological applications. Nevertheless, where necessary this paper proposes clear ethical boundaries, legal principles and suggests several steps that should be taken by responsible regulators in international level.

"Clear identification of areas vulnerable to waterborne diseases is essential for protecting community health. This is particularly important in developing countries where unsafe disposal of domestic wastewater and limited potable water supply pose potential public health risks. However, data paucity can be a compounding issue. Under these circumstances, landscape epidemiology can be applied as a resource efficient approach for mapping potential disease risk areas associated with poor sanitation. However, in order to realise the full potential offered by this approach, an in-depth understanding of the impact of different classes of an explanatory variable on a target disease and the validity of hotspot analysis using limited datasets is needed. Accordingly, this research study focused on typhoid and diarrhoea incidence with respect to different classes of elevation, flood inundation, land use, soil permeability, population density and rainfall as explanatory variables. An integrated methodology consisting of hot spot analysis and Poisson regression was employed to map potential disease risk areas. The study findings confirmed the significant differences in the influence exerted by the various classes of an explanatory variable in relation to a target disease. The results also confirmed the feasibility of the hotspot analysis for identifying areas vulnerable to the target diseases using a limited dataset. The study outcomes are expected to contribute to creating an in-depth understanding of the relationship between disease prevalence and associated landscape factors for the delineation of disease risk zones in the context of data paucity.

"With the increasing deployment of network systems, network attacks are increasing in intensity as well as complexity. Along with these increasing network attacks, many network intrusion detection techniques have been proposed which are broadly classified as being signature-based, classification-based, or anomaly based. A deployable network intrusion detection system (NIDS) should be capable of detecting of known and unknown attacks in near real time with very low false positive rate. Supervised approaches for intrusion detection provides good detection accuracy for known attacks, but they can not detect unknown attacks. Some of the existing NIDS emphasize on unknown attack detection by using unsupervised anomaly detection techniques, but they can not distinguish network data as accurately as supervised approaches. Moreover they do not consider some other important issues like real time detection or minimization of false alarm. To overcome these problems, in the recent years many hybrid NIDS have been proposed which are basically aimed at detecting both known and unknown attacks with high accuracy of detection. In this literature review on hybrid network intrusion detection systems, we will discuss a few of the notable hybrid NIDS proposed in the recent years and will try to provide a comparative study on them.

"Analytical method based on magnetic equivalent circuits (MEC) is widely used for the preliminary machine design due to short calculation time and low computational cost, but the calculate result is normally considered to be not as accurate as finite element method (FEM). To address the MEC less accurate and FEM time-consuming challenge, a novel design and analysis procedure of permanent magnet synchronous generators (PMSGs) was proposed in this paper. The initial physical and electromagnetic features of PMSGs were presented by MEC at first design stages, the electromagnetic analyses were realized by FEM based on electromagnetic simulation software. The field-circuit coupled design method could facilitate accuracy and shorten time cycle of the generator design. Using RMxprt as simulation tool had realized the convenient and fast modeling, the parametric analysis of armature diameter, axial length, air gap and number of conductors per slots were carried out. The results show that the magnetic density distribution of the generators becomes better, and the efficiency is improved. The validity and applicability of the method is verified. Moreover, it will provide a basis for the further 3D optimization design of the generators.

"Giardia duodenalis is a flagellated intestinal protozoan responsible for infections in various hosts including humans and several wild and domestic animals. Few studies have correlated environmental contamination and clinical infections in the same region. The aim of this study was to compare groups of Giardia duodenalis from clinical and environmental sources through population genetic analyses to verify haplotype sharing and the degree of genetic similarity among populations from clinical and environmental sources in the metropolitan region of Campinas. The results showed high diversity of haplotypes and substantial genetic similarity between clinical and environmental groups of G.duodenalis. We demonstrated sharing of Giardia genotypes among the different populations studied. The comparison between veterinary and human sequences led us to identify new zoonotic genotypes, including human isolates from genetic assemblage C. The application of a population genetic analysis in epidemiological studies allows quantification of the degree of genetic similarity among populations of Giardia duodenalis from different sources of contamination. The genetic similarity of Giardia isolates among human, veterinary, and environmental groups reinforced the correlation between clinical and environmental isolates in this region, which is of great importance for public health.

"Flash floods are among the most severe hazards which have disastrous environmental, human, and economic impacts. This study is interested in the characterization of flood hazard in Gabes Catchment (southeastern Tunisia), considered as an important step for flood management in the region. Analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and geographic information system are applied to delineate and characterize flood areas. A spatial database was developed based on geological map, digital elevation model, land use, and rainfall data in order to evaluate the different factors susceptible to affect flood analysis. However, the uncertainties that are associated with AHP techniques may significantly impact the results. Flood susceptibility is analyzed as a function of weights using Monte Carlo (MC) simulation and Global sensitivity analysis. AHP and MC-AHP models gave similar results. However, compared to AHP approach, MC-AHP confidence intervals (95%) of the overall scores had small overlaps. Results obtained were validated by remote sensing data for the zones that showed very high flood hazard during the extreme rainfall event of June 2014 that hit the study basin.

"Generating synthetically mixed data from library spectra provides a direct means to train empirical regression models for subpixel mapping. In order to best represent the subpixel composition of image data, the generation of synthetic mixtures must incorporate a multitude of mixing possibilities. This can lead to an excessive amount of training samples. We show that increasing mixing complexity in the training set improves model performance when quantifying urban land cover with support vector regression (SVR). To cope with the challenging increase in the number of training samples, we propose the use of ensemble learning based on bootstrap aggregation from synthetically mixed training data. The workflow is tested on simulated spaceborne imaging spectrometer data acquired over Berlin, Germany. Comparisons to SVR without bagging and multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis reveal the usefulness of the methodology for quantitative urban mapping.

"Alert intelligent device is an ambient assisted living (AAL) system that allows the evaluation of potentially dangerous situations for elderly people living alone at home. This evaluation is obtained by an ad hoc network of sensor nodes, working in conjunction with an ambient intelligence layer embedded in a personal computer that learns from user behaviour patterns and warns when a detected pattern differs significantly from previously acquired normal patterns. Each new datum read from sensors is processed in the ambient intelligence layer through three processing levels: shallow, intermediate and deep. The shallow processing level focuses on physical data and sensory features. The intermediate level covers information interpretation and its translation into the form required by the third level: the reasoning processing or deep level. In alert intelligent device, energy is a critical issue, so that sensor devices need to be properly designed and managed to achieve significant energy saving. The use of bed/chair occupancy sensors is mandatory for this kind of ubiquitous computing system. A first way to approach this problem relied on the use of pressure mats, but several environmental drawbacks showed them inappropriate as an efficient and reliable solution for large volume deployments. Moreover, solutions based on force-to-resistor transducers entail power consumption budgets that keep them from being integrated on wireless sensor nodes. In this paper, a force-capacitive transducer based sensor has been proposed, implemented and tested. This sensor is based on electromechanical film (EMFi) transducers, which are able to detect force variations in a quasi-passive way. This kind of transducer behaves as capacitors with variable capacitance depending on the force exerted on its surface. We have developed a new technique to carry out the characterization of these transducers, where the detection of a force change is used to trigger an active mechanism that allows us to measure the weight by means of a novel modelling approach. A low-power wireless sensor node prototype that includes this new transducer has been assembled and tested on a wide range of weights. Occupancy detection achieved by this technology has proven to be successful, increasing the total power consumption of the node by less than 15%, which makes it suitable for implementation.

"Aquatic habitat assessment and river restoration design require geospatially explicit maps of hydraulic conditions. Diverse mechanistic ecohydraulic models compute spatially explicit depth and velocity results to evaluate habitat suitability spatially as a function of these abiotic conditions. This study compared depth and velocity results from two-dimensional (2D) and one-dimensional (1D) hydraulic models with algorithms that laterally discretize 1D velocity and interpolate depth and velocity spatially based on the Laplacian heat mapping approach. These 'conveyance distributed' methods constitute 'best 1D modelling practice' and were compared with 2D results for the first time. The 1D and 2D models were applied to three morphologically distinct reaches (leveed, meandering, and anastomosing) for three flows (base, bankfull, and flood flows) of the partially regulated, gravel/cobble lower Yuba River in north-central California. The test metrics were the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the median absolute residual (vertical bar(epsilon) over tilde vertical bar). These metrics quantified the incremental uncertainty 1D approximation incurs, results which make explicit cost-benefit processes of model selection possible. Finally, velocity residual maps were analysed to identify regions and processes where residuals were high, indicating divergence from the 1D assumptions. Paired data (1D-2D) fell between 0.94 = R-2 = 1.00 (R-mean(2) = 0.98 and R-median(2)= 0.99) for depth and median absolute residuals were all 3.8 <= vertical bar(epsilon) over tilde vertical bar <= 7.2% (i. e. 50% of residuals are approximately within +/- 1.7 to 3.6%). Higher flows and lower gradient reaches had lower residuals and higher R-2. Velocity diverged more, particularly for base flow in anastomosing reaches (0.42< R-2 < 0.58). One-dimensional, conveyance distributed, assumptions performed better for other channel types, where 0.6922.4% (i. e. similar to +/- 4.6 to +/- 11.2%), where vertical bar(epsilon) over tilde vertical bar(mean) = 14.2% and vertical bar(epsilon) over tilde vertical bar(median) = 13% (similar to +/- 7.1 and 6.5%). The conveyance distributed 1D velocity model performed best, where the orthogonal flow assumptions obtained and where side channels did not transition from backwater to conveying area between flows.

"This paper argues that implicit self-stereotyping is moderated by the potential for social evaluation in that situation. It was hypothesized that implicit self-stereotyping is facilitated when social cues (i.e., gaze cues) signal social evaluation. This study examined whether gaze cues affected implicit self-stereotyping related to gender stereotypes regarding math competence. A pilot study demonstrated that just a presentation of direct-gaze cues (vs. averted-gaze cues) signaled social evaluation and social norms. The main study revealed that gender differences in math identity were more prominent under direct-gaze cues, relative to averted-gaze cues. Women showed more negative math identity than men did when they were exposed to direct-gaze cues, but not when exposed to averted-gaze cues. Moreover, these effects were particularly prominent among women with stronger implicit math-gender stereotypes and female identity. These findings improve our understanding of how and when implicit self-stereotyping occurs in social situations.

"Platelet activation in response to stimulation of the Protease Activated Receptor 4 (PAR4) receptor differs by race. One factor that contributes to this difference is the expression level of Phosphatidylcholine Transfer Protein (PCTP), a regulator of platelet PAR4 function. We have conducted an expression Quantitative Trait Locus (eQTL) analysis that identifies single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to the expression level of platelet genes. This analysis revealed 26 SNPs associated with the expression level of PCTP at genome-wide significance (p < 5x10-8). Using annotation from ENCODE and other public data we prioritised one of these SNPs, rs2912553, for functional testing. The allelic frequency of rs2912553 is racially-dimorphic, in concordance with the racially differential expression of PCTP. Reporter gene assays confirmed that the single nucleotide change caused by rs2912553 altered the transcriptional potency of the surrounding genomic locus. Electromobility shift assays, luciferase assays, and overexpression studies indicated a role for the megakaryocytic transcription factor GATA1. In summary, we have integrated multi-omic data to identify and functionalise an eQTL. This, along with the previously described relationship between PCTP and PAR4 function, allows us to characterise a genotype- phenotype relationship through the mechanism of gene expression.

"Parliamentary websites have become one of the most important windows for citizens and media to follow the activities of their legislatures and to hold parliaments to account. Therefore, most parliamentary institutions aim to provide new multimedia solutions capable of displaying video fragments on demand on plenary activities. This paper presents a multimedia system for parliamentary institutions to produce video fragments on demand through a website with linked information and public feedback that helps to explain the content shown in these fragments. A prototype implementation has been developed for the Canary Islands Parliament (Spain) and shows how traditional parliamentary streaming systems can be enhanced by the use of semantics and computer vision for video analytics. The semantic web technologies used make search capabilities on parliamentary websites available to users to retrieve video fragments on demand with accurate and timely information. In addition, video analytic techniques enable the automation of identifying representative keyframes to be annotated by parliamentary experts. As a result, parliaments are able to enhance citizens' access to information and ensure that these institutions are more open andaccountable on their websites and; at the same time, the labor-intensive tasks of parliamentary experts are considerably reduced.

"Ascospores are frequently found as airborne fungal spores and recognized in various areas as an important cause of respiratory allergies. The main objective of the study was to determine the relationship between airborne ascospores and meteorological parameters using multivariate canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and Spearman correlation. The aerobiological monitoring of fungal spores was performed over 5 years (2009-2013) using a Burkard volumetric spore traps. Seven main types of ascospores were identified: Leptosphaeria, Pleospora, Venturia, Diatrype, Chaetomium, Sporormiella and Ascobolus. The CCA results showed that all applied variables accounted for 27.4 % of the total variance in the spore data in the 5 years. The largest contribution to the total variance was explained in this period by the maximum air temperature (10.3 %). The effect of meteorological factors varied among years. The highest values of the total variance in the spore data, explained by the statistically significant variables, were observed in 2012 (28.6 %), with the highest contribution to minimum relative humidity (8.0 %). Most ascospores showed positive and statistically significant correlation with relative humidity and rainfall. In contrast, ascospores of Chaetomium were negatively correlated with precipitation and the relative humidity and positively with temperature. Based on these results, epidemiological and allergological studies must deserve more attention to estimate the allergenic potential of the ascospores.

"Most intranasal oxytocin research to date has been carried out in men, but recent studies indicate that females' responses can differ substantially from males'. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involved an all-female sample of 28 women not using hormonal contraception. Participants viewed animations of geometric shapes depicting either random movement or social interactions such as playing, chasing, or fighting. Probe questions asked whether any shapes were friends or not friends. Social videos were preceded by cues to attend to either social relationships or physical size changes. All subjects received intranasal placebo spray at scan 1. While the experimenter was not blinded to nasal spray contents at Scan 1, the participants were. Scan 2 followed a randomized, double-blind design. At scan 2, half received a second placebo dose while the other half received 24 III of intranasal oxytocin. We measured neural responses to these animations at baseline, as well as the change in neural activity induced by oxytocin. Oxytocin reduced activation in early visual cortex and dorsal-stream motion processing regions for the social >size contrast, indicating reduced activity related to social attention. Oxytocin also reduced endorsements that shapes were friends or not friends, and this significantly correlated with reduction in neural activation. Furthermore, participants who perceived fewer social relationships at baseline were more likely to show oxytocin-induced increases in a broad network of regions involved in social perception and social cognition, suggesting that lower social processing at baseline may predict more positive neural responses to oxytocin.

"Anxiety disorders are one of the most common and debilitating mental illnesses worldwide. Growing evidence indicates an age-dependent rise in the incidence of anxiety disorders from adolescence through adulthood, suggestive of underlying neurodevelopmental mechanisms. Kappa opioid receptors (KORs) are known to contribute to the development and expression of anxiety; however, the functional role of KORs in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), a brain structure critical in mediating anxiety, particularly across ontogeny, are unknown. Using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology in acute brain slices from adolescent (postnatal day (P) 30-45) and adult (P60+) male Sprague-Dawley rats, we found that the KOR agonist, U69593, increased the frequency of GABA(A)-mediated spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in the adolescent BLA, without an effect in the adult BLA or on sIPSC amplitude at either age. The KOR effect was blocked by the KOR antagonist, nor-BNI, which alone did not alter GABA transmission at either age, and the effect of the KOR agonist was TTX-sensitive. Additionally, KOR activation did not alter glutamatergic transmission in the BLA at either age. In contrast, U69593 inhibited sIPSC frequency in the central amygdala (CeA) at both ages, without altering sIPSC amplitude. Western blot analysis of KOR expression indicated that KOR levels were not different between the two ages in either the BLA or CeA. This is the first study to provide compelling evidence for a novel and unique neuromodulatory switch in one of the primary brain regions involved in initiating and mediating anxiety that may contribute to the ontogenic rise in anxiety disorders.

"Using data collected in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom, this article examines the determinants of attitudes toward immigrants. In particular, we draw on the literature in social psychology to explore the role of locus of control in promoting more ethnocentric and restrictive attitudes towards immigration. We conceptualize control at three levels: (1) perceptions of individual locus of control (i.e., feeling that one can control one's own circumstances), (2) perceptions of societal control (i.e., feeling that one's country has control over immigration), and (3) perceptions of an outgroup's locus of control (i.e., feeling that an outgroup's social circumstances are attributable to dispositional rather than external factors). Results show that all three measures of control are important predictors of negative attitudes toward immigrants: Those who feel in control (personally or as a society) are less hostile towards immigrants, while those who attribute negative outcomes to immigrants' predispositions are also more hostile. Results also suggest that measures of control are related to, but distinct from, both partisanship and racial prejudice.

"The authors examined the role of sympathy and moral respect in children's overt aggression, and the subtypes of proactive and reactive aggression, in an ethnically diverse sample of 5-, 7-, and 10-year-olds (N = 110). Aggressive behaviors were measured through teacher reports and peer nominations. Sympathy was assessed through teacher reports. Children reported on their moral respect within an interview procedure where they were asked for their feelings of respect toward hypothetical peers who displayed morally relevant behaviors. Results revealed that sympathy and moral respect were both negatively related to overt aggression and to the proactive aggression subtype, but unrelated to the reactive aggression subtype. The authors discuss the implications of the findings in relation to developmental research on the affective antecedents of children's aggressive behavior.

"Many aerosol retrieval algorithms based on the remote sensing technology have been developed and applied to produce aerosol optical depth ( AOD) products for different satellite sensors. The dark target (DT) and deep blue (DB) algorithms are two main MODIS aerosol retrieval algorithms that are suitable for dark or bright areas. The estimation of land surface reflectance (LSR) is necessary to improve the accuracy of AOD retrievals. Therefore, in this paper, a new procedure to improve LSR estimation using MODIS surface reflectance products is developed. A new high-resolutionaerosol retrieval algorithm with a priori LSR database support (HARLS) is proposed. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the spatial adaptability of different MODIS AOD products produced by the above three algorithms. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (Jing-Jin-Ji) region, which features complex surface structures and serious air pollution, was chosen as the study area, and the different AOD products are validated using aerosol robotic network (AERONET) AOD ground measurements from four stations located in dark and bright areas. Comparedwith the DT retrievals (R approximate to 0.88 -0.95), the C6 DB AOD retrievals yield a stronger correlation (R approximate to 0.94 - 0.97) with AERONET AOD and lower RMSE, MRE and MAE values, resulting in approximately 20%-30% less average overestimation. The C6 DT& DBAODresults showa retrieval quality (R approximate to 0.93 - 0.97) similar to that of DB, with approximately 50%-70% of the collections falling within the expected error (EE). Moreover, DT& DB is much better than DT, with more than approximately 10%-20% of the collections falling within the EE. However, HARLS achieves a high correlation (R approximate to 0.93 - 0.96) with the AERONET AODs, with low RMSE (approximate to 0.118 - 0.128) andMAE (approximate to 0.09 - 0.12) and small offsets (intercept approximate to 0.00 -0.04). HARLS retrievals exhibited 7%-8% less uncertainty than the C6 DB retrievals, 37%-38% less uncertainty than the C6 DT& DB retrievals, and 39%-44% less uncertainty than the C5 and C6 DT retrievals. HARLS achieves greater accuracy and reliability in AODretrieval, and it is less biased(RMB approximate to 0.90 -1.10) and better overall than the routine MODIS aerosol products over the Jing-Jin-Ji region.

"The development of water-saving cultivation techniques has been attracting increased attention worldwide. A rainwater harvesting system known as ridge-furrow with plastic film mulching (RFPFM) has gradually become a promising cultivation method in semiarid rain-fed ecosystems in China. However, it is not well documented, whether this system can be practiced in a semi-humid region where irrigation is available. Field studies comparing three cultivation patterns (rainfed flat planting as CK, RFPFM, and well-irrigated planting pattern: WI) across two different nitrogen (N) rates and two cultivars were conducted for two consecutive years to assess the potential role of RFPFM in improving the water use efficiency (WUE) of winter wheat in a dry semi-humid region of northwest China. The high soil moisture and favourable temperature during the seedling establishing period in the topsoil under RFPFM practice contributed to the emergence of the seedlings 2 days earlier than for CK. Its superiority, also resulted in longer growth duration but also resulting in earlier spikelet and spike differentiation, thereby increasing the grain number per spike, spike number per m(-2) and wheat yield under RFPFM practice compared with CK. The highest yield of 9.7 t ha(-1) was achieved in WI combined with a higher N application condition. RFPFM practice resulted in up to approximately 74% of the yield of WI treatment with higher N application, while increasing WUE by 53.7% and 46.3% compared with CK and WI practices, respectively. In addition, RFPFM practice, in comparison with CK, increased the N fertilizer productivity and N uptake efficiency by 52.5% and 44.2%, respectively, averaged across others treatment and years. We highly recommend RFPFM practices with the N rate of 75 kg ha(-1) as a water-saving technology and a promising strategy to increase wheat yield and WUE in the current agro-ecosystem of northwest China.

"Random Forest (RF) is a widely used classifier to show a good performance of hyperspectral data classification. However, such performance could be improved by increasing the diversity that characterizes the ensemble architecture. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble approach, namely rotation random forest via kernel principal component analysis (RoRF-KPCA). In particular, the original feature space is first randomly split into several subsets, and KPCA is performed on each subset to extract high order statistics. The obtained feature sets are merged and used as input to an RF classifier. Finally, the results achieved at each step are fused by a majority vote. Experimental analysis is conducted using real hyperspectral remote sensing images to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in comparison with RF, rotation forest, support vector machines, and RoRF-PCA. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

"Doppler lidars with a high pulse repetition frequency are susceptible to range ambiguities from clouds and other distant targets with large backscatter. These range ambiguities degrade the quality of wind profiles and other calculated or retrieved variables. Here, a technique to detect and remove range-folded returns from the moment observations is proposed and described. A simplified method of removing erroneous wind observations from range-folded returns is also detailed. Through detection and removal of range-folded echoes, the quality and accuracy of wind profiles are shown to improve.

"The optimal design of electrical machines is an important issue in automotive industry in order to reduce cost and volume of the actuator and improve its performances. In this context, the use of compact machines with high power density is preferred and consequently high speed machines where field weakening is required. In addition, a really optimal design requires to dispose sufficiently accurate models of main physical phenomena involved in electromechanical conversion. This models need to be sufficiently fast in order to be suitable with optimization process. An important limitation in the use of internal permanent magnet synchronous machine with distributed windings is temperatures insides the machine especially in the windings and thus the internal losses. At high speed with field weakening operation, iron losses, sensitive to flux densities variation in iron, could be really high because of the high electrical frequency linked to rotor speed and sharp variation of flux density waveforms inside the iron in stator due to the field weakening operation. This study, for the electric machine design, is based on the first harmonic hypothesis, i.e., without harmonic currents. An original and mathematical model has been developed and provides fast and accurate estimation of iron losses particularly in field weakening operation even with machine supplied by sinusoidal currents as described in this paper. It uses a polynomial form of iron losses in function of fundamental electrical frequency and take into account the flux density waveforms in yoke and teeth by use of nonlinear iron coefficients linked to i(d)-i(q) currents. This paper will present the complete method calculating the iron coefficients from a nonlinear magnetic nodal network of the machine. A detailed study of local flux density waveform and harmonic content in yoke and teeth will be provided for two particular operating points: at maximal power without field weakening and at maximal power at maximal speed. These two points require accurate estimation in an optimal design of electrical machine. In addition, the local iron coefficients in teeth and yoke per volume unit will be provided in order to study the local evolution of iron losses in field weakening operation. It will show that iron losses do not follow the same evolution in the yoke and the teeth by the fact that the flux density distribution in teeth is more sensitive to the field weakening. An application of this model will be provided for the calculation of iron losses on whole operating space for a specific machine. A comparison will be provided between the fast model and finite elements approach. (C) 2016 International Association for Mathematics and Computers in Simulation (IMACS). Published by Elsevier B.V.

"The eastern hognose snake (Heterodon platirhinos) is a species of conservation concern, especially in the northeastern portion of its range. They remain relatively common at Cape Cod National Seashore, Barnstable County, Massachusetts, USA, where we studied their spatial ecology and habitat selection. We radio-tracked 17 adult snakes (10 F, 7 M) from May 2009 to November 2011, yielding 765 relocations. We conducted a use-availability analysis to investigate patterns of microhabitat selection using a subset of snake locations. We conducted a compositional analysis of habitat selection at multiple spatial scales within home ranges using a high-resolution (1-m pixel size) vegetation cover map of the study area. Snakes moved frequently and had large home ranges (x = 35.4 ha) relative to other snake species of similar body size but exhibited variation in home range size among individuals (1- 209 ha). Movements peaked at different times of year for each sex, and were most different between sexes in fall. In gravid females, movement was significantly greater in the 2-week post-oviposition period versus the 2-week pre-oviposition period. Estimates of home range and average daily movements (x = 30.1 m/day) were lower than estimates from other studies of eastern hognose snakes, possibly because of a greater density of resources at our study area. Probability of snake habitat use increased with grass and leaf litter and decreased with open soil. Compositional analysis revealed a strong avoidance of open dune areas. A comparison of edge density between use and random locations within home ranges revealed an apparent preference for edge habitat. We recommend that resource managers should limit recreational disturbance to and maintain the patchy mosaic of early successional vegetation with abundant edge to ensure the persistence of appropriate habitat for the species. We identified the timing of peak seasonal movements and recommend that this information be used to help prevent road mortality for this important population. (C) 2017 The Wildlife Society.

"Some norbenzomorphans exhibit high affinity for sigma 1 and sigma 2 receptors, and varying the position of substituents on the aromatic ring of this scaffold has a significant effect on subtype selectivity. In particular, compounds bearing several different substituents at C7 of the norbenzomorphan ring system exhibit a general preference for the sigma 1 receptor, whereas the corresponding C8-substituted analogues preferentially bind at the sigma 2 receptor. These findings suggest that the norbenzomorphan scaffold may be a unique chemical template that can be easily tuned to prepare small molecules for use as tool compounds to study the specific biological effects arising from preferential binding at either sigma receptor subtype. In the absence of structural characterization data for the sigma 2 receptor, such compounds will be useful toward refining the pharmacophore model of its binding site.

An important concern in AmI's applications is privacy. Addressing design by privacy, an important challenge to consider is the development of an architecture that includes the different privacy policies and how can we fusion them in a specific application domain.

"The recent TAU computer-aided design (CAD) contest has aimed to seek novel ideas for accurate and fast common path pessimism removal (CPPR). Unnecessary pessimism forces the static timing analysis tool to report worse violation than the true timing properties owned by physical circuits, thereby misleading signoff timing into a lower clock frequency at which circuits can operate than actual silicon implementations. Therefore, we introduce in this paper UI-Timer 1.0, a powerful CPPR algorithm which achieves high accuracy and ultrafast runtime. Unlike existing approaches which are dominated by explicit path search, UI-Timer 1.0 proves that by implicit path representation the amount of search effort can be significantly reduced. Our timer is superior in both space and time saving, from which memory storage and important timing quantities are available in constant space and constant time per path during the search. Experimental results on industrial benchmarks released from TAU 2014 CAD contest have justified that UI-Timer 1.0 achieved the best result in terms of accuracy and runtime over existing CPPR algorithms.

We characterized the MHC class I of two Korean amphibians, the Asiatic toad (Bufo gargarizans) and the Japanese tree frog (Hyla japonica). We found at least four transcribed MHC class I (MHC I) loci, the highest number confirmed in any anuran to date. Furthermore, we identified MHC I transcripts in terrestrial adults, and possibly in aquatic larvae, of both species. We conducted a phylogenetic analysis based on MHC I sequence data and found that B. gargarizans and H. japonica cluster together in the superfamily Nobleobatrachia. We further identified three supertypes shared by the two species. Our results reveal substantial variation in the number of MHC I loci in anurans and suggest that certain supertypes have particular physiochemical properties that may confer pathogen resistance.

"End-to-end learning machines enable a direct mapping from the raw input data to the desired outputs, eliminating the need for hand-crafted features. Despite less engineering effort than the hand-crafted counterparts, these learning machines achieve extremely good results for many computer vision and medical image analysis tasks. Two dominant classes of end-to-end learning machines are massive-training artificial neural networks (MTANNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Although MTANNs have been actively used for a number of medical image analysis tasks over the past two decades, CNNs have recently gained popularity in the field of medical imaging. In this study, we have compared these two successful learning machines both experimentally and theoretically. For that purpose, we considered two well-studied topics in the field of medical image analysis: detection of lung nodules and distinction between benign and malignant lung nodules in computed tomography (CT). For a thorough analysis, we used 2 optimized MTANN architectures and 4 distinct CNN architectures that have different depths. Our experiments demonstrated that the performance of MTANNs was substantially higher than that of CNN when using only limited training data. With a larger training dataset, the performance gap became less evident even though the margin was still significant. Specifically, for nodule detection, MTANNs generated 2.7 false positives per patient at 100% sensitivity, which was significantly (p < 0.05) lower than the best performing CNN model with 22.7 false positives per patient at the same level of sensitivity. For nodule classification, MTANNs yielded an area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.8806 (95% CI: 0.8389-0.9223), which was significantly (p < 0.05) greater than the best performing CNN model with an AUC of 0.7755 (95% CI: 0.7120-0.8270). Thus, with limited training data, MTANNs would be a suitable end-to-end machine-learning model for detection and classification of focal lesions that do not require high-level semantic features.

"The cognitive load placed on users by both the proactive and spontaneous provisioning of service functionality and by the physical activities performed in ambient intelligence environments can lead to the depletion of their mental resources. This paper demonstrates how burdening the inappropriate selection of service functionality can be for users by conducting a semi-naturalistic and controlled user test to investigate the significance of the cognitive resource depletion problem in specific ambient intelligence environments. A dynamic service binding and scheduling mechanism is provided based on different types of interference and on mental resources and their demand requirements. A technical evaluation is conducted by simulating the mechanism over a set of various abstract service compositions, making use of real datasets of user interactions with diverse HCI services and daily physical activities. The results show that this mechanism ensures less cognitively taxing, unobtrusive service composition provisioning.

"Biomarkers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are not yet validated for use in clinical settings. We aim to provide a methodological framework for their systematic validation, by reference to that developed for oncology biomarkers. As for this discipline, the steps for the systematic validation of AD biomarkers need to target analytical validity, clinical validity, and clinical utility. However, the premises are different from oncology: the nature of disease (neurodegeneration vs. cancer), the purpose (improve diagnosis in clinically affected vs. screening preclinical individuals), and the target population (mild cognitive impairment patients referring to memory clinics vs. general population) lead to important differences, influencing both the design of validation studies and the use of selected biomarkers. This framework is applied within a wider initiative to assess the current available evidence on the clinical validity of biomarkers for AD, for the final aim to identify gaps and research priorities, and to inform coordinated research efforts boosting AD biomarkers research.

"Studies in a variety of species have reported enhanced prosocial effects after an acute administration of the neuromodulating hormone, oxytocin (OT). Although the exact mechanisms underlying these effects are not fully understood, there is broad interest in developing OT into a treatment for social deficits. Only a few studies, however, have examined the effects of OT if given repeatedly during early development, the period when early intervention is likely to have the greatest benefits for reversing the progression towards social impairment. Those studies, exclusively in rodents, report mixed results. Some have shown enhancement of prosocial behavior, including increased social exploration, but others have shown antisocial effects, including increased aggression. In the present study, infant rhesus macaques were treated with a high-frequency (3 x per week) or low-frequency (1 x per week) dose of intranasal oxytocin (IN-OT) or placebo (IN-saline) between two and six months of age, after which their reactions to dynamic facial expressions (neutral, lipsmacking and threats) were measured. Results showed that IN-OT, compared to placebo, increased the time monkeys spent viewing the expression videos, but selectively reduced attention to the eyes in neutral faces in a dose dependent manner. The mechanism for this non-prosocial effect may be that repeated IN-OT administration down-regulates the expression of OT receptors in brain regions important for regulating social attention. Consequently, our results raise questions about the efficacy of implementing chronic IN-OT as a pharmacotherapy for the treatment of social deficits, particularly if given early in development. More work is needed, not only to identify optimal treatment schedules, but also to understand how IN-OT exerts its influences on the brain and behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Instead of the usual ratings of broad personality traits, however, our domains represented peer ratings of narrow exemplars of personality traits. Specifically, we compared roommate ratings on (a) observable trait-related behaviors with (b) unobservable trait-related attitudes or beliefs. We observed greater self-peer agreement in rating behaviors, in general, than in rating beliefs. We also observed greater tendency of raters to adopt an assumed similarity heuristic when judging their roommates' attitudes and beliefs than their behaviors. We discuss the contribution of these findings to understanding the determinants of accuracy in personality judgments and developing best practices for personality assessment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

"Retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), the outermost layer of the retina, has a key role in maintaining retinal cells' functions. Severity of the culture of RPE cells has exerted many limitations to both in vitro and in vivo studies and its therapeutic applications. Therefore, establishment of RPE cell lines with high proliferative potential can considerably improve study of RPE cell biology. Here we report generation of a spontaneously immortalized murine RPE cell line in primary mouse RPE cell culture. Founded colonized cells were picked up and expression of RPE and retinal progenitor cells' (RPC) markers were studied using immunocytochemistry (ICC). Emerged cells cultured over 35 passages and population doubling times in different serum concentrations were calculated. We also investigated the ability of cells for becoming transfected by calcium-phosphate method and for becoming infected by adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (AAV2) using flow cytometry. Data showed that the cobblestone constituent cells expressed RPE65, cytokeratin and 201 and moreover several progenitor markers such as Pax6, Sox2, Nestin and Chx10. It revealed that, despite primary RPE cells, the newly emerged cells were easily transfectable and were highly infectable when compared with HEK293T cells. Our data indicated that the emerged mouse RPE cell line pretended RPC-like phenotype and also simultaneously expressed RPE markers. It would be a promising model for leading studies on RPE and RPC cells and substantially confirmed the great RPE plasticity and its invaluable potential in research studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"We present a bit-string quantum oblivious transfer protocol based on single-qubit rotations. Our protocol is built upon a previously proposed quantum public-key protocol and its practical security relies on the laws of Quantum Mechanics. Practical security is reflected in the fact that, due to technological limitations, the receiver (Bob) of the transferred bit-string is restricted to performing only 'few-qubit' coherent measurements. We also present a single-bit oblivious transfer based on the proposed bit-string protocol. The protocol can be implemented with current technology based on optics.

"This paper presents the development, implementation and evaluation of an online tool for personalized mobile learning of engineering graphics. The online tool is designed to support the widespread mobile operating systems, such as Android, iOS, Windows 10 Mobile, as well as to be interactive and to enable learning by doing''. The framework for the developed tool includes Dropbox, as the file storage application, and AutoCAD 360, as an interactive CAD application with various tools for drawing. The study was conducted on a sample of 30 undergraduate students. The students were divided into the experimental group, using the developed online tool for personalized mobile learning, and the control group, using traditional learning tools. A statistical analysis of both samples was carried out in order to study the effectiveness of this online tool in the learning process. The results of the final test showed that the students from the experimental group were more successful than the students from the control group. Therefore, the use of the developed online tool for personalized mobile learning of engineering graphics can be considered an improvement in the teaching of engineering graphics.

"This special feature results from the symposium 'Ants 2016: ant interactions with their biotic environments' held in Munich in May 2016 and deals with the interactions between ants and other insects, plants, microbes and fungi, studied at micro- and macroevolutionary levels with a wide range of approaches, from field ecology to next-generation sequencing, chemical ecology and molecular genetics. In this paper, we review key aspects of these biotic interactions to provide background information for the papers of this special feature. After listing the major types of biotic interactions that ants engage in, we present a brief overview of ant/ant communication, ant/plant interactions, ant/fungus symbioses, and recent insights about ants and their endosymbionts. Using a large molecular clock-dated Formicidae phylogeny, we map the evolutionary origins of different ant clades' interactions with plants, fungi and hemiptera. Ants' biotic interactions provide ideal systems to address fundamental ecological and evolutionary questions about mutualism, coevolution, adaptation and animal communication.

"A novel nonparametric system identification (SI) algorithm is described, focusing on PID-based control loops for buck converters with effective series resistance (ESR) in the output filter. Dithering amplification effects on the control path are exploited during the steady-state converter operation. The noise injected is used to stimulate the loop reaction and to identify the output filter configuration. Oversampling-dithering features of third-order Delta Sigma modulators are used to increase the DPWM resolution during the converter nominal operation and, moreover, as the core key to compute the SI algorithm. A modified structure of a noise shaper is used to handle the resolution of the SI algorithm over a range of the desired frequencies during the nonparametric identification. The SI algorithm comprises two steps: the first processing step extracts the resonant frequency, and the second extracts the ESR zero from the power spectrum density computation of the control feedback error. The SI method has been validated with different buck converter configurations, and has successfully been integrated and measured into a digitally controlled buck converters prototype for automotive safety application.

"The Passive Moderator Cooling System (PMCS) of the Advanced Heavy Water Reactor is designed to remove heat from the moderator passively in case of an extended station black out condition (SBO). The hot heavy-water moderator inside the Calandria rises upward due to buoyancy, cooled in a shell and tube heat exchanger (located within the loop) and returns back to the Calandria, completing a natural circulation loop. The heat exchanger, in turn, is cooled by water from a Gravity Driven Water Pool (GDWP); forming a second loop. This coupled natural circulation loop system provides sufficient cooling to prevent the increase of moderator temperature inside the Calandria vessel beyond safe limits during SBO. The feasibility of such a system should be assessed before it is implemented in the reactor. Thus, a scaled test facility was set up to simulate the thermal hydraulic characteristics of the PMCS. A set of time varying power experiments were performed, which capture the flow initiation from rest phenomena and the multidimensional natural convection flow in a coupled natural circulation system. Next, the experimental geometry was simulated using the three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics code (OpenFoam 2.2.0), which predicted temperature and flow distribution inside the system. The CFD results agree well with the experimental data within +/- 6%. The flow initiation phenomena shows that the initial flow generated recirculates within the Calandria, after similar to 900 s the flow is able to come out of the Calandria. The experiments show a time lag between the starting of the primary and secondary loop circulation. This work demonstrates the experimental and computational capability to understand and design an effective Passive Moderator Cooling System. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"To examine the cultural organization of collaboration, 50 U.S. Mexican-heritage sibling pairs (ages 6-11) were videotaped as they participated in a puzzle construction activity. Half were from families with more recent connection with rural practices, and limited schooling (pueblo families) and half from high schooling families (more connection with middle-class practices, higher schooling). Children were given a previously constructed model, parts to construct another, and left alone. Every 10 s coders noted how the siblings coordinated either: jointly engaged, checking-in, solo, or off-task and if collaboration was organized either verbally, nonverbally, or with multiple means. Children from Pueblo families engaged jointly and used nonverbal and multiple means of communication more than children from high schooling families who more often worked solo, were off-task, and used talk to communicate. Results are linked to practices in Indigenous American communities where children's Learning by Observing and Pitching In is common. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"The practice of rainwater harvesting (RWH) is spreading rapidly in urban areas. This article studies the impact of a possible generalization of this practice for municipalities by proposing a new method to quantify the potential for potable water savings (PPWS) by using rainwater harvesting at the urban level. The proposed method is based on the adaptation of an already validated model assessing the PPWS for single buildings and the use of urban databases. Two concepts are introduced: (1) the building type that allows gathering all the buildings sharing common features; and (2) the equivalent building, which is used to assess the PPWS of a set of buildings (of a same building type) as if it were a single building. In the case of the municipality of Colombes (located in the suburbs of Paris), the method shows that the PPWS by using rainwater harvesting represents about 10% of the total potable water consumption: the residential buildings account for 64% of this potential. This method can be applied to other municipalities with a level of acceptable reliability with regard to the means to be implemented in terms of collecting information.

"Past research has shown that individuals low in prejudice think more carefully when information is from or about stigmatized individuals than non-stigmatized individuals. One explanation for this effect is that the heightened scrutiny stems from a motivation to guard against potential prejudice toward stigmatized others (i.e. watchdog motivation). The present research tested a variation of the watchdog hypothesis based on the idea of implicit ambivalence. Specifically, we argue that among individuals low in explicit (i.e., deliberative) prejudice, it is those who are also relatively high in implicit (i.e., automatic) prejudice who will do the most processing in prejudice relevant contexts. The implicit ambivalence framework also makes a novel prediction that individuals who are relatively high in explicit prejudice but low in implicit prejudice would also engage in enhanced information processing. As predicted, people with racial implicit-explicit attitude discrepancies, regardless of the direction of discrepancy, were found to engage in greater of scrutiny of a message about the hiring of Black faculty (study 1), a message about a Black job candidate (study 2), and even when the Black concept was merely primed subliminally prior to reading a race-irrelevant message (study 3).

"Social projection and self-stereotyping are rival explanations for self-other correspondence, in which people tend to perceive a high degree of similarity between themselves and others. The present research shows that both accounts are correct-that is, that knowledge of the self and knowledge of others are mutually constraining. In Study 1, participants whose self-views were experimentally manipulated revised their judgments of an immediate ingroup. In Study 2, an analogous manipulation of ingroup traits altered participants' self-views. In Study 3, participants who were ascribed a trait readily projected to and stereotyped from their relevant ingroup, but not to or from an outgroup. Finally, Study 4 provides reaction-latency evidence for social projection and self-stereotyping as judgmental processes leading to self-other correspondence. In this task, participants referenced self-knowledge when reaching ingroup-descriptiveness judgments (evidence for social projection) and ingroup knowledge when judging the self (evidence for self-stereotyping). Implications for the debate between protocentric and egocentric accounts of person perception are discussed.

"Purpose of review One of the most important challenges in the intestinal ( ITx) and multivisceral transplant ( MVTx) is to achieve a successful abdominal wall closure. Recent findings A tension-free primary closure should be our aim. In most of the cases, we need to perform a component separation technique, alone or combined, to the use of a synthetic mesh. If those options are not feasible, the abdominal wall composite vascularized allograft transplant ( AW-CVA) utilizing direct orthotopic vascularization can be considered. The nonvascularized abdominal rectus fascia has also become an alternative method used worldwide, proving to be simple and well tolerated procedure. Furthermore, the use of the AW has been recently proposed as a new tool for a sentinel monitoring of the intestinal or pancreas allograft. Summary There are different validated options for abdominal wall closure following intestinal transplantation. The long-term benefits of transplanting the abdominal wall, full or partial thickness and vascularized or nonvascularised, were shown. New developments might help to expand their applications in different areas such as reconstructive surgery and immunology.

"Two vignette studies were conducted in which preadolescent children (Study 1: N = 542; Study 2: N = 137; aged 8-13 years) evaluated the exclusion, for unknown reasons, of an immigrant minority child by a native majority peer (majority interethnic exclusion). Study 1 compared children's evaluations of majority interethnic exclusion with their evaluations of (majority and minority) intraethnic exclusion and minority interethnic exclusion, and Study 2 examined children's underlying explanations. Each study compared ethnic majority and ethnic minority respondents and examined the role of in-group bias for the former. Overall, both ethnic majority and ethnic minority respondents regarded majority interethnic exclusion more negatively than the other exclusion types (majority intraethnic, minority interethnic, and minority intraethnic). All children, but especially older minority respondents, were more likely to reject majority interethnic exclusion if they perceived it to be discriminatory (ethnicity based). Among the majority children, a strong in-group bias was associated with a weaker condemnation of majority interethnic exclusion, but this was not due to a larger tolerance of ethnicity-based discrimination. Biased majority children were also less likely to reject minority intraethnic exclusion, indicating an overall weaker concern for out-group victims. Taken together, the studies show that children are relatively negative about majority (prototypical) interethnic exclusion because it implies the possibility of ethnic discrimination, and they concur with previous evidence for a developmental increase in the awareness of discrimination in ethnic minority youths.

"Previous studies have demonstrated that targeting bradykinin receptors is a promising strategy to counteract the cognitive impairment related with aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The hippocampus is critical for cognition, and abnormalities in this brain region are linked to the decline in mental ability. Nevertheless, the impact of bradykinin signaling on hippocampal function is unknown. Therefore, we sought to determine the role of hippocampal bradykinin receptors B1R and B2R on the cognitive decline of middle-aged rats. Twelve-month-old rats exhibited impaired ability to acquire and retrieve spatial information in the Morris water maze task. A single intra-hippocampal injection of the selective B1R antagonist des-Arg(9)-[Leu(8)]-bradykinin (DALBK, 3 nmol), but not the selective B2R antagonist D-Arg-[Hyp(3),Thi(5),D-Tic(7),Oic(8)]-BK (Hoe 140, 3 nmol), reversed the spatial learning and memory deficits on these animals. However, both drugs did not affect the cognitive function in 3-month-old rats, suggesting absence of nootropic properties. Molecular biology analysis revealed an up-regulation of B1R expression in the hippocampal CA1 sub-region and in the pre-frontal cortex of 12-month-old rats, whereas no changes in the B2R expression were observed in middle-aged rats. These findings provide new evidence that inappropriate hippocampal B1R expression and activation exert a critical role on the spatial learning and memory deficits in middle-aged rats. Therefore, selective B1R antagonists, especially orally active non-peptide antagonists, may represent drugs of potential interest to counteract the age-related cognitive decline.

"In this study, an in vitro device that mimics the oral phase of swallowing is calibrated using in vivo measurements. The oral flow behavior of different Newtonian and non-Newtonian solutions is then investigated in vitro, revealing that shear-thinning thickeners used in the treatment of dysphagia behave very similar to low-viscosity Newtonian liquids during active swallowing, but provide better control of the bolus before the swallow is initiated. A theoretical model is used to interpret the experimental results and enables the identification of two dynamical regimes for the flow of the bolus: first, an inertial regime of constant acceleration dependent on the applied force and system inertia, possibly followed by a viscous regime in which the viscosity governs the constant velocity of the bolus. This mechanistic understanding provides a plausible explanation for similarities and differences in swallowing performance of shear-thinning and Newtonian liquids. Finally, the physiological implications of the model and experimental results are discussed. In vitro and theoretical results suggest that individuals with poor tongue strength are more sensitive to overly thickened boluses. The model also suggests that while the effects of system inertia are significant, the density of the bolus itself plays a negligible role in its dynamics. This is confirmed by experiments on a high density contrast agent used for videofluoroscopy, revealing that Theologically matched contrast agents and thickener solutions flow very similarly. In vitro experiments and theoretical insights can help designing novel thickener formulations before clinical evaluations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"To date there is one proven hydrocarbon accumulation on the Ashmore Platform, Bonaparte Basin, Australia, with hydrocarbon charge remaining a key exploration risk. To the south, the neighbouring Browse Basin has proven lateral migration of generated hydrocarbons to the basin bounding highs, as evidenced by seeps located on the Yampi Shelf. This paper describes the findings of a natural seeps study carried out to establish if migrating subsurface hydrocarbons reach the southern flanks of the Ashmore Platform basement high. The integrated study combined remote sensing, geophysical, acoustic, photographic and geochemical techniques and has identified three areas of seepage; one area characteristic of persistent seepage and two areas of interpreted episodic leakage. Geochemical data collected from samples at one of these sites demonstrates the presence of thermogenic liquid hydrocarbons, with isotopic compositions falling within the range of values exhibited by oils sourced by the Lower Cretaceous Echuca Shoals Formation. The identification of active natural seepage along the southern flank of the Ashmore Platform provides evidence that hydrocarbons generated within the Caswell Sub-basin are able to laterally migrate onto the flanks of the Ashmore Platform structural high. As such, these findings reduce charge risk for the Ashmore Platform and regional exploration risks in the northern Browse Basin. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is a method of capturing rainfall from a catchment surface and storing it for later use. Though it has been around for thousands of years, its popularity and use has been increasing in recent years and water quality within RWH systems has become a concern. Water temperature is a parameter that affects water quality, and storage container color and shading affect this temperature. Rainwater storage containers with four different colors kept at three different shadings were used to study the effects of shading and container color on water temperature. Temperatures of water stored in these containers were monitored over 20 weeks during a Texas summer Statistical analyses showed that the color and shade variables had an interaction and thus both together had an effect on the water temperature. Because of this, individual treatment variables could not be analyzed and compared statistically. However, the trends showed that light colors and higher shading caused lower water temperatures in the storage containers. Also, the color had more pronounced effect than shading on water temperature inside the containers.

"Developmental lead (Pb) exposure is suggested in laboratory studies to be a trigger for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sortilin-related receptor, L (DLR class) A repeats-containing (SORL1) is a recently identified AD genetic risk factor. SORL1 has limited characterization in vertebrate models in comparison to other AD genetic risk factors. To characterize SORL1 further, protein sequence homology between humans, mice and zebrafish was analyzed and showed conservation of functional repeats and domain orientation. Next, spatial expression of sorl1 in zebrafish larvae was completed and diffuse expression in neural tissue that was not restricted to the brain was observed. Influences of sex and age on quantitative expression of sorl1 in the brain of adult zebrafish were then assessed. Sex-specific alteration of sorl1 expression transpired during the aging process in females. The zebrafish was then utilized to investigate the impacts of a 100ppb embryonic Pb exposure on sorl1 expression and other known AD genetic risk factors. Sex-specific quantitative gene expression analysis was completed with adult zebrafish brain to compare those developmentally exposed to Pb or a control treatment, but no significant difference in sorl1 expression or other AD genetic risk factors was observed. Overall, this study provided characterization of sorl1 with changes in brain expression during aging being female-specific. This finding is in agreement with females being more prone to the onset of AD, but analysis of additional AD genetic risk factors is needed to facilitate our understanding of the impact of a 100ppb embryonic Pb exposure.

"The ridge furrow rainwater harvesting (RFRH) system with different ridge covering materials as mulch for collecting runoff water is a valuable technique for enhancing seed filling rates and maize productivity. Therefore, a field experiments were conducted during 2 consecutive years in 2014-15, under large mobile rain-proof shelter at the Institute of Water Saving Agriculture in Semi-Arid Areas of China. Objectives of this study were enhancing soil water storage, promoting seed filling and yield of maize, with following two planting models: (i) traditional flat planting (CK); (ii) ridges covered with different mulching material (plastic film (PM), biodegradable film (BM), soil crust ridges (SC)); and two simulated rainfall levels: 320 mm and 430 mm rainfall. Results of this work revealed that mulching material on ridges had distinct effect on soil water storage in the 200 cm depth of soil at the middle of furrows and in the order of PM430 approximate to BM430 >SC430 >PM320 >BM320 >SC320, compared to CK320 and CK430, respectively. The average seed yield increased by 27%, 23% and 17% for PM320, BM320, and SC320, compared to CK320, and increased by 30%, 25% and 12% for PM430, BM430 and SC430 as compared to CK430 over 2 consecutive years, respectively. Average WUE significantly improved by (P < 0.05) in PM430 and PM320. BM430, BM320, SC320, and SC430 were 32.8%, 29.7%, 24.8%, 24.2%, 17.6% and 8.5% over 2 years compared to CK320 and CK430, respectively. The effect of RFRH system on maize seed filling was significantly related to the simulated rainfall levels and the position of the seeds on the ear. Both PM320 and BM320 significantly (P <0.05) promoted the seed filling rates of the superior, middle and inferior seeds. Seed-filling rates of the superior, middle and inferior seeds at the PM430 were also significantly increased. Our results suggested that PM430 and BM430 both significantly increased the SWS during the seed-filling process; which resulted higher grain yield and might have potential for reducing maize productivity risk under dry-land farming system.

"With the disturbing increase of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in Malaysia, a lot of efforts and studies are put forward towards understanding and managing matters related to ASD. One way is to find means of easing the social communications among these children and their caretakers, particularly during intervention. If the caretaker is able to comprehend the children emotional state of mind prior to therapy, some sort of trust and attachment will be developed. However, regulating emotions is a challenge to these children. Nonverbal communication such as facial expression is difficult for ASD children. Therefore, we proposed the use of walking patterns (i.e. gait) to detect the type of emotions of ASD children. Even though using gait for emotion recognition is common among normal individuals, none can be found done on children with ASD. Thus, the aim of this paper is to conduct a preliminary review on the possibilities of carrying out gait-based emotion detection among ASD children with regards to the emotional types, gait parameters and methods of gait data acquisition.

"The increasing popularity of DVFS (dynamic voltage frequency scaling) schemes for portable low power applications demands highly efficient on chip DC-DC converters. The primary aim of this work is to enable increased efficiency of on-chip DC-DC conversion for near-threshold operation of multi-core architectures. The main idea is to supply nominal (high) off-chip voltage to a multi-core processor where cores are then voltage-stacked to generate a near-threshold (low) voltage based on Kirchhoff's voltage law through charge recycling. However this implicit down-conversion can be affected by the current imbalance between the cores. A push-pull switched-capacitor regulator has been designed to keep the mid voltage close to the near-threshold value of half-V-dd. Stacked-voltage domain with its self-regulation capability combined with push-pull based switch capacitor regulator has shown an average efficiency of more than 90% for 2:1 down conversion with workload imbalance varying up to 50% of I-load.

"Recently, cortisol has been suggested to moderate the positive relationship between testosterone and antisocial behavior. More precisely, high testosterone levels have been found to be related to aggressive or dominant behavior especially when cortisol levels were low. In the present study, we aimed to extend these findings to pro-environmental behavior as an indicator of prosocial behavior. In a first step, 147 male participants provided information on their everyday pro-environmental behavior by completing an online questionnaire on various energy-saving behaviors. In a second step, subjects provided two saliva samples for the assessment of testosterone and cortisol on two subsequent mornings after awakening. We found that testosterone was negatively related to pro-environmental behavior, but only in men with low cortisol. In conclusion, our findings provide first evidence for the joint association of testosterone and cortisol with everyday pro-environmental behavior. These results further reinforce the importance of considering interdependent hormone systems simultaneously rather than focusing on a single hormone.

"Beginning in infancy, before a diagnosis is made, children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) show significant impairments in the foundation for social-communication interactions including eye gaze in the contexts of both requesting and joint attention (JA). Addressing these early impairments as early as possible in toddlers who receive the diagnosis of ASD provides them with a foundational social-communication repertoire necessary for learning. In this study we examined the effects of a social-communication intervention involving prompting and reinforcement to teach gaze shift (GS; shifting gaze from an object to the interventionist's eyes) in the context of responding to a request and initiating JA to four toddlers with ASD. Intervention lasted 3-9 weeks with all toddlers demonstrating GS to mastery across both contexts. Toddlers also showed generalization to a repertoire of social-communication behavior, including initiating requests and increases in smiling. Some improvements in symptoms of ASD and overall functioning were observed. Results suggest a promising brief intervention to address the earliest form of social communication that remains a part of successful social-communication interactions throughout life.

"Cooperative behavior is widespread among animals, yet the neural mechanisms have not been studied in detail. We examined cooperative territory defense behavior and associated neural activity in candidate forebrain regions in the cichlid fish, Astatotilapia burtoni. We find that a territorial male neighbor will engage in territory defense dependent on the perceived threat of the intruder. The resident male, on the other hand, engages in defense based on the size and behavior of his partner, the neighbor. In the neighbor, we find that an index of engagement correlates with neural activity in the putative homolog of the mammalian basolateral amygdala and in the preoptic area, as well as in preoptic dopaminergic neurons. In the resident, neighbor behavior is correlated with neural activity in the homolog of the mammalian hippocampus. Overall, we find distinct neural activity patterns between the neighbor and the resident, suggesting that an individual perceives and processes an intruder challenge differently during cooperative territory defense depending on its own behavioral role.

"We examined the relationships between Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (ADNC), Lewy body disease (LBD), and vascular brain injury (VBI) in 2 large autopsy samples. Because findings may differ between study populations, data came from U. S. Alzheimer's Disease Centers contributing to the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (n = 2742) and from the population-based Adult Changes in Thought study (n = 499). Regardless of study population, over 50% of participants with ADNC had cooccurring LBD or VBI; the majority of whom had a clinical AD dementia diagnosis prior to death. Overlap of pathologies was similar between studies, especially after standardizing to the distribution of age and dementia status in the Adult Changes in Thought population. LBD, but not VBI, was positively associated with ADNC in both studies. Interestingly, cortical LBD was more common in those with intermediate ADNC compared to low or high ADNC, especially in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (p < 0.001). High prevalence of co-occurring neuropathologies among older adults with dementia has implications for accurate diagnosis of dementia etiologies and development of disease-modifying strategies.

"In the last decade, bioinformatic analyses of high-throughput proteomics and transcriptomics data have enabled researchers to gain insight into the molecular networks that may underlie lasting changes in synaptic efficacy. Development and utilization of these techniques have advanced the field of learning and memory significantly. It is now possible to move from the study of activity-dependent changes of a single protein to modeling entire network changes that require local protein synthesis. This data revolution has necessitated the development of alternative computational and statistical techniques to analyze and understand the patterns contained within. Thus, the focus of this review is to provide a synopsis of the journey and evolution toward big data techniques to address still unanswered questions regarding how synapses are modified to strengthen neuronal circuits. We first review the seminal studies that demonstrated the pivotal role played by local mRNA translation as the mechanism underlying the enhancement of enduring synaptic activity. In the interest of those who are new to the field, we provide a brief overview of molecular biology and biochemical techniques utilized for sample preparation to identify locally translated proteins using RNA sequencing and proteomics, as well as the computational approaches used to analyze these data. While many mRNAs have been identified, few have been shown to be locally synthesized. To this end, we review techniques currently being utilized to visualize new protein synthesis, a task that has proven to be the most difficult aspect of the field. Finally, we provide examples of future applications to test the physiological relevance of locally synthesized proteins identified by big data approaches.

"Network security situation prediction is of great significance for the use of the Internet, and it is the focus of production and life issues. Under the guidance of the model combination forecasting method, In this paper, based on the Kalman filtering model a new method of network security prediction is presented, which is based on the theory of decision entropy. In this method, the Kalman state equation and measurement equation are constructed according to the key attributes of the network security state, and then combined with the decision entropy theory to predict the future state of network security. The experimental results show that the proposed method has high prediction accuracy and is suitable for the state prediction of network security.

"Mining activities are among the major culprits of the wide occurrences of soil and water pollution by PAHs in coal district, which have resulted in ecological fragilities and health risk for local residents. Sixteen PAHs in multimedia environment from the Heshan coal district of Guangxi, South China, were measured, aiming to investigate the contamination level, distribution and possible sources and to estimate the potential health risks of PAHs. The average concentrations of 16 PAHs in the coal, coal gangue, soil, surface water and groundwater were 5114.56, 4551.10, 1280.12 ng g(-1), 426.98 and 381.20 ng L-1, respectively. Additionally, higher soil and water PAH concentrations were detected in the vicinities of coal or coal gangue dump. Composition analysis, isomeric ratio, Pearson correlation analysis and principal component analysis were performed to diagnose the potential sources of PAHs in different environmental matrices, suggesting the dominant inputs of PAHs from coal/coal combustion and coal gangue in the soil and water. Soil and water guidelines and the incremental lifetime risk (ICLR) were used to assess the health risk, showing that soil and water were heavily contaminated by PAHs, and mean ICLRcoal/coal-gangue and mean ICLRsoil were both significantly higher than the acceptable levels (1 x 10(-4)), posing high potential carcinogenic risk to residents, especially coal workers. This study highlights the environmental pollution problems and public health concerns of coal mining, particularly the potential occupational health hazards of coal miners exposed in Heshan.

"Accumulated research has shown that Western Christian religiosity often predicts prejudice toward various kinds of outgroups. On the contrary, initial recent evidence indicates that East Asian religiosity predicts tolerance of various outgroups-except atheists. To understand these differences, we investigated cognitive (intolerance of contradiction) and emotional (disgust) mechanisms possibly mediating the link between religiosity and prejudice versus tolerance. In Study 1 (295 Westerners of Christian tradition), high disgust contamination and, to some extent, intolerance of contradiction mediated the relationship between religiosity and prejudice against ethnic (Africans), religious (Muslims), moral (homosexuals), and convictional (atheists) outgroups. However, in Study 2 (196 Taiwanese of Buddhist or Taoist tradition), religiosity was unrelated to disgust, and predicted low intolerance of contradiction, and thus tolerance of the same religious, ethnic, and moral outgroups-but still not of atheists. Cultural differences in cognition and emotion seem to explain East-West differences in religious prejudice.

"Despite high activity for photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes from water, nanoscale Ag3PO4 photocatalyst particles are difficult to synthesize. As reported in literature, Ag3PO4 particle sizes for photocatalytic degradation of water pollutants are normally larger than 100 nm. This research reports a facile and reproducible method for the synthesis of the ultrafine and uniform Ag3PO4 nanoparticles loaded on the oxygen vacated TiO2 (TiO2-OV) with average particle size as small as 2.6nm. All obtained Ag3PO4 particles can be completely loaded onto TiO2-OV support to form Ag3PO4/TiO2-OV composite photo catalysts. The prepared Ag3PO4/TiO2-OV photocatalyst exhibits much higher visible light photocatalytic activity than those of pure Ag3PO4 or Ag3PO4/TiO2 photocatalysts for the degradation of rhodamine b (Rh B) and phenol in water. After depositing thin layers of Agl on Ag3PO4 ultrafine Ag3PO4 nanoparticles, the new AgI-Ag3PO4/TiO2-OV composite photocatalysts not only show much higher photocatalytic activity, but they are also more stable than pure Ag3PO4 catalyst. This new synthesis method will provide guidelines for the preparation of ultrafine nanoparticles and highly active photocatalysts for treatment of water pollution or production of hydrogen from water splitting/reducing.

"Burgers-Huxley equations and their reduced form are of vital importance in modeling the interaction between reaction mechanisms, convection effects and diffusion transports. In this paper, we applied the reduced form of differential transform method (reduced-DTM), present in previous works (Abazari and Borhanifar, Comput Math Appl 59:2711-2722, 2010; Borhanifar and Abazari, J Appl Math Comput 35:37-51, 2011; Borhanifar and Abazari, Opt Commun 283:2026-2031, 2010; Abazari and Ganji, Int J Comput Math 88(8):1749-1762, 2011; Abazari and Abazari, Commun Nonlinear Sci Numer Simul 17:619629, 2012), to solving Burgers-Huxley equations and their three reduced equations, namely, the Burgers equation, the Huxley equation and the Burgers-Fisher equation. The results obtained employing RDTM are compared with previous semi-analytical methods, such as HPM (He, Appl Math Comput 135:73-79, 2003), HAM (Liao, Beyond perturbation: introduction to the homotopy analysis method. Chapman & Hall/CRC Press, Boca Raton, 2003), DTM (Zhou, Differential transformation and its application for electrical circuits. Huazhong University Press, Wuhan, 1986) and exact solution. As an important result, it is depicted that the RDTM results are more accurate in comparison with those obtained by classic HPM, HAM and DTM. The numerical results reveal that the RDTM is very effective, convenient and quite accurate to time dependance kind of nonlinear equations. It is predicted that the RDTM can be found widely applicable in engineering.

"The eastern coastal areas of China have high-density population, developed society and economy, and large water pollution emissions. How to reduce water pollution and realize the coordinated development of the economy and environment has become the national focus. Effective environmental policies should consider regional differences in development stage and sustainability performance. Here, we first analyzed the water pollution emissions intensity of the eastern coastal areas of China and the urgency of emissions reduction using 8-year environmental statistics from 2003 to 2010. We characterized development stages of the eastern coastal areas based on the relationships between water pollution emissions intensity and economic development. Further, we built a coordination degree index of economic development and water environment protection as a measure of sustainability. Results show that water pollution emissions intensity decreases as the economy grows from 2003 to 2010. The less-developed regions have a better coordination degree than some more-developed regions, especially those most-developed ones (e.g., Shanghai show more pressures on long-term sustainability than Hebei). The less-developed regions should take advantage of economic growth to invest more advanced environment protection technologies. The more-developed regions need to upgrade its economic structures and municipal infrastructures. Overall, the study provided a comprehensive approach to understand regional difference in development stage and sustainability performance in the eastern coastal region of China as well as the need of different environmental policies to reduce water pollution emissions.

"Objective: The purpose of this study is to present an ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patient with fracture-dislocation of C7/T1, who got reduction and fixation successfully by surgical treatment. Methods: A 36-year-old Chinese male with 22-years history of AS was admitted to our Emergency Department (ED) complaining about sensory and motor disturbance for 12 hours due to the fall at home. AS and fracture-dislocation of C7/T1 were diagnosed by personal history, neurological examination and X-ray, CT and MRI. Results: Posterior cervical instrumentation and fusion from C5 to T3 (lateral mass screws of C5, C6 and pedicle screws of C7, T2, T3). Meanwhile, satellite rod was placed in C7-T2 to disperse stress. The lamina and ossified ligamentum flavum of both C7 and T1 were removed for decompression; no extra-dural hematoma was observed. Given the patient's longstanding history of AS, the fracture-dislocation site was highly unstable, combined anterior and posterior fixation was performed. Then, the patient underwent open reduction, internal fixation of C7-T1 fracture and anterior cervical plating with iliac crest autogenous bone grafting. The patient did well postoperatively, his neurological state recovered to Frankel D, with muscle strength of 3 of 5 in the upper extremities and 3+ of 5 in the lower extremities. Although neurological improvement was minor, his motivation increased, and pain from his neck disappeared. Conclusion: Surgical treatment of AS patients with subaxial unstable fracture-dislocation can be performed successfully.

"Previous studies have suggested that real-time person perception relies on continuous competition, in which partially active categories smoothly compete over time. Here, two studies demonstrated the involvement of a different kind of competition. In Study 1, before participants selected the correct sex category for morphed faces, their mouse trajectories often exhibited a continuous attraction toward the incorrect category that increased with sex-category ambiguity, indicating continuous competition. On other trials, however, trajectories initially pursued the incorrect category and then abruptly redirected toward the correct category, suggesting early incorrect category activation that was rapidly reversed later in processing. These abrupt category reversals also increased with ambiguity. In Study 2, participants were presented with faces containing a sex-typical or sex-atypical hair cue, in a context in which the norm was either sex-typical targets (normative context) or sex-atypical targets (counternormative context). Sex-atypical targets induced greater competition in the normative context, but sex-typical targets induced greater competition in the counternormative context. Together, these results demonstrate that categorizing others involves both smooth competition and abrupt category shifts, and that these flexibly adapt to the social context.

"Inherited genetic variants contribute to risk factors for developing an alcohol use disorder, and polymorphisms may inform precision medicine strategies for treating alcohol addiction. Targeting genetic mutations linked to alcohol phenotypes has provided promising initial evidence for reducing relapse rates in alcoholics. Although successful in some studies, there are conflicting findings and the reports of adverse effects may ultimately limit their clinical utility, suggesting that novel pharmacogenetic targets are necessary to advance precision medicine approaches. Here, we describe promising novel genetic variants derived from preclinical models of alcohol consumption and dependence that may uncover disease mechanisms that drive uncontrolled drinking and identify novel pharmacogenetic targets that facilitate therapeutic intervention for the treatment of alcohol use disorder.

"Due to the grave situation of China's water environment and aquatic ecosystems, it is of prime importance to understand the present situation of China's water resources vulnerability, and how this situation has evolved over the recent past. Consequently, we performed a comprehensive spatio-temporal analysis of China's water resources vulnerability over the period 2003-2013, using a composite index approach with an array of aspects highlighting key challenges that China's water resources system is facing. Water resources in the northern and central coasts appeared more vulnerable than in western China. China's water productivity has grown substantially over the study period, and so has safe drinking water and improved sanitation accessibility. In contrast, water pollution has been worsening remarkably in most parts of China, and so has water scarcity and shortage in the most stressed parts of the country. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"Colloidal behavior of a widely used non-ionic emulsifier, sorbitan monooleate (Span80), was investigated in non-polar solvents (cyclohexane and xylene) using electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The electrical characteristics of the colloidal mixtures were measured with frequency scans ranging from 1 Hz to 200 kHz. The conductances at low frequencies were found to increase with an increase in Span80 concentration. The source of conductivity for non-polar solvents using non-ionic emulsifiers is usually attributed to ionic impurities either in the Span80 or in the non-polar solvents. The measured electrical characteristics for pure Span80 and pure non-polar solvents revealed that the source of ionic conduction is impurities in Span80. It was confirmed that the ionic impurities in the non-polar solvents are in form of aggregate of ions, ion-pairs, and triple ions which is unaffected with the emulsifier concentration. Analyses using equivalent electrical circuits confirmed that the critical Maxwell-Wagner frequency is 0.6-1.8 Hz for the mixtures. The conductance-concentration profiles for the mixtures at 1 Hz showed transitions from a square root to a linear concentration dependence at the CMC. This indicated that the dissociation model holds below the CMC, while the fluctuation model applies above the CMC. The conductance profiles enabled estimates of the relative hydrophilic core radius and the fraction of charged micelles in both non-polar solvents.

"The methods used to analyze the slope stability are commonly based on limit equilibrium theory and are expressed in terms of a factor of safety. However, an analysis that approaches the variability of the soil parameters and model uncertainties becomes necessary. In this paper, a pre-designed reinforcement slope available on the technical literature was chosen to a probabilistic analysis. The statistic information about the parameters was found in the literature and the numerical simulations were done in the software SLOPE/W. Besides, a parametric analysis was done varying the coefficient of variability of unit weight and friction angle to investigate the effect of the variability on the reliability of the slope. Also, the contribution of water level was measured. The results show relevant variation on the reliability index with the parametric analysis, indicating the importance of this study. Furthermore, the water level has a decisive impact on safety and reliability of the slope. Lastly, the reinforcement with geotextiles was efficient to increase the safety of slopes.

"Cryptolaemus montrouzieri (mealybug destroyer) is a predatory ladybird of Australian origin and has been introduced worldwide to control mealybugs. However, no simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker has been developed for C. montrouzieri, hampering study of its population genetics. We developed and characterized 12 novel SSR markers from expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in C montrouzieri, which proved to be sufficiently polymorphic for population genetic analysis. The results of a population genetic analysis using these markers reveal strong genetic differentiation in ten native and introduced populations, which were not seen in our previous results using mitochondrial markers. Four populations probably underwent a recent genetic bottleneck and one wild population was probably the result of an admixture of two lab-reared populations. Our results from these newly developed EST-SSR markers suggest a strong genetic differentiation among populations of this widely introduced biological control agent. Greater attention should be paid to bottleneck effects, mito-nuclear discordance and admixture for further population genetic analysis, prediction of invasiveness and practical use of the ladybird in biological control.

"Species of genus Garcinia belonging to family Clusiaceae are traditionally known for the treatment of ulcer, gonorrhea, leucorrhoea and abdominal pain. This genus is also reported to be a rich source of xanthones, benzophenones, flavonoids, biflavonoids and triterpenes showing significant pharmacological activities. Garcinia mangostana L. (mangosteen) and Garcinia hombroniana Pierre (seashore mangosteen) are evergreen tropical trees grown in Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and other tropical countries. The fruits of G. mangostana (queen of fruits), and roots and leaves decoction of G. hombroniana are commonly used for skin allergies, infections after childbirth, trauma and diarrhea. This study aimed to evaluate the bark and fruit extracts of G. mangostana and G. hombroniana for phytochemicals analysis, total phenolic and flavonoid contents, antioxidant, anti-hyperglycemic and antituberculosis activities. Total phenolic contents were evaluated by Folin-Ciocalteu reagent colorimetric method. For antioxidant activities, radical scavenging assays of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2'-azino-bis-3-ethyl benzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS), and ferric ion reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) were used. Antihyperglycemic activity was determined using a-glucosidase and a-amylase enzymes. In quantitative phytochemical analysis, the extracts of G. mangostana showed significantly higher content of phenolics [3498.7 mu M GAE/g (gallic acid equivalent per gram), ethyl acetate; bark], carbohydrates (14.2 g/100g, aqueous; fruit) and reducing sugars (13.9 g/100g, aqueous; fruit). Also, in antioxidant activities, G. mangostana showed comparatively high activities with the ethyl acetate extract as the most potent showing IC50 2.78 mu g/ml in DPPH, 1.19 mu g/ml in ABTS, and 8742.7 mu M TE/g in FRAP assays. G. mangostana was also more potent in anti-hyperglycemic properties (IC50 182.9 mu g/ml, alpha-glucosidase, 247.8 mu g/ml, alpha-amylase) compared to G. hombroniana. In antituberculosis study, the ethyl acetate extracts of both plants showed equipotent activity with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 62.5 mu g/ml. Based on the results, it was concluded that the presence of bioactive phytochemicals may be responsible for their traditional uses for treatment of diseases.

"Research suggests that members of advantaged groups who feel dehumanized by other groups respond aggressively. But little is known about how meta-dehumanization affects disadvantaged minority group members, historically the primary targets of dehumanization. We examine this important question in the context of the 2016 U.S. Republican Primaries, which have witnessed the widespread derogation and dehumanization of Mexican immigrants and Muslims. Two initial studies document that Americans blatantly dehumanize Mexican immigrants and Muslims; this dehumanization uniquely predicts support for aggressive policies proposed by Republican nominees, and dehumanization is highly associated with supporting Republican candidates (especially Donald Trump). Two further studies show that, in this climate, Latinos and Muslims in the United States feel heavily dehumanized, which predicts hostile responses including support for violent versus non-violent collective action and unwillingness to assist counterterrorism efforts. Our results extend theorizing on dehumanization, and suggest that it may have cyclical and self-fulfilling consequences.

"This paper introduces a high power density step-up converter for LED applications, based on a hybrid serial-output (HSO) architecture [1], which is suitable for on-chip implementation. In this system, the output voltage is formed by stacking the output of a switched-capacitor (SC) converter on top of a boost converter output. The high power density SC converter processes around a half of the power of the system and is left unregulated. The boost converter processes the remainder of the power and regulates the output voltage. In comparison with conventional boost-based solutions, the introduced boost-SC HSO drastically reduces the passive component volume and decreases peak voltage stress of switches. Experimental results obtained with a 3.7 V to 13 V, 2.6 W, 1080 kHz prototype show that the introduced SC-boost HSO converter has about three times smaller reactive component area than a conventional boost having the same power processing efficiency.

"Within the framework of EUROfusion Program, the Dual Coolant Lithium Lead (DCLL) is one of the four EU breeder blanket concepts that are being investigated as candidates for DEMO. DCLL uses PbLi as the main coolant, tritium breeder, tritium carrier, and neutron multiplier. The main structures, including the first wall, are cooled with helium. The EU program proposed for the next years will consider a DCLL version limited to 550 degrees C in order to allow the use of conventional materials and technologies. During the first year of EUROfusion activities, a draft design of the DCLL has been proposed. The main blanket performances were adapted to the new specifications and the CAD model of DEMO. The breeder zone has been toroidally divided into four parallel PbLi circuits, separated through stiffening grid radial walls. The PbLi flow routing has been designed to maximize the amount of thermal power extracted by flowing PbLi and to avoid the occurrence of reverse flows due to volumetric heating. Thermal hydraulics, magnetohydrodynamic and neutronics calculations have been performed for the first draft design. The new DCLL design employs Eurofer-alumina-Eurofer sandwich as flow channel insert (FCI).

"Individuals often hold ambivalent attitudes (i.e., positive and negative attitudes at the same time) toward groups and social categories. The aim of the present research was to examine the differential effects of affective and cognitive dimensions of ambivalence on the (amplification of) responses towards a minority group. We asked 188 students from the University of Perugia to read a short description of a fictitious group of immigrants. After expressing their affective and cognitive attitudes toward the target group, participants received positive, negative, or no supplementary information about this group. Discrimination was assessed by asking participants to allocate to the target group a percentage of a financial support fund for poor people (both Italian and immigrant) living in their regional area. As expected, we found that only affective ambivalence amplified either negative or positive responses toward the group.

"Novel diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease (AD) incorporate biomarkers, but their maturity for implementation in clinical practice at the prodromal stage (mild cognitive impairment [ MCI]) is unclear. Here, we evaluate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) beta-amyloid42 (A beta 42), total tau, and phosphorylated tau in the light of a 5-phase framework for biomarker development. Ample evidence is available for phase 1 (identifying useful leads) and phase 2 (assessing the accuracy for AD dementia versus controls) for CSF biomarkers. Phase 3 (utility in MCI) is partially achieved. In cohorts with long follow-up time, CSF A beta 42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau have high diagnostic accuracy for MCI due to AD. Phase 4 (performance in real world) is ongoing, and phase 5 studies (quantify impact and costs) are to come. Our results highlight priorities to pursue and to enable the proper use of CSF biomarkers in the clinic. Priorities are to reduce measurement variability by introduction of fully automated assay systems; to increase diagnostic specificity toward non-AD neurocognitive diseases at the MCI stage; and to clarify the role of CSF biomarkers versus other biomarker modalities in clinical practice and in design of clinical trials. These efforts are currently ongoing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

"A new sub-space max-monomial modeling scheme for CMOS transistors in sub-micron technologies is proposed to improve the modeling accuracy. Major electrical parameters of CMOS transistors in each sub-space from the design space are modeled with max-monomials. This approach is demonstrated to have a better accuracy for sub-micron technologies than singlespace models. Sub-space modeling based geometric programming power optimization has been successfully applied to three different op-amps in 0.18 mu m technology. HSPICE simulation results show that sub-space modeling based GP optimization can allow efficient and accurate analog design. Computational effort can be managed to an acceptable level when searching sub-spaces for transistors by using practical constraints. An efficient scheme in dealing with non-convex constraint inherent in Kirchhoff's voltage law is suggested in this paper. By using this scheme, the nonconvex constraint, such as posynomial equality, can be relaxed to a convex constraint without affecting the result.

Therefore, it is intriguing that a lung microbiota can shape pulmonary immunity and epithelial barrier functions. Here, we discuss the ways how the composition of the microbial community in the lung may influence pulmonary health and vice versa, factors that determine community composition. Prominent microbiota at other body sites such as the intestinal one may also contribute to pulmonary health and disease. However, it is difficult to discriminate between influences of lung vs. gut microbiota due to systemic mutuality between both communities. With focuses on asthma and respiratory infections, we discuss how microbiota of lung and gut can determine pulmonary immunity and barrier functions.

"After critically reviewing the divisions of imitation as proposed by Dryden and Genette, among others, the author discusses the evolution of this concept, from its origins to its latest development in modern England. His aim is to build an objective model for analyzing imitation as a form of translation. He then analyzes a case study from East Asia: Japanese manga imitations of the Chinese novel The Journey to the West, in particular Minekura Kazuya's 1997-2002 Journey to the Extreme (Gens (o) over bar maden Saiy (u) over bar ki). The author seeks to show how the changes made by the manga artists to the plot and characters exemplify ways in which imitations function in a new context. The article ends with some historical reflections on the position of imitation in translation theory and practice, while relating it to the contemporary context. It is hoped that the discussion will contribute to dispelling the misunderstandings and prejudice towards imitation, at the same time encouraging renewed attention to this old concept.

"Background: Serum p-cresyl sulfate (PCS) associates with cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic kidney disease. PCS concentrations are determined by intestinal uptake of p-cresol, human metabolism to PCS and renal clearance. Whether intestinal uptake of p-cresol itself is directly associated with cardiovascular disease in patients with renal dysfunction has not been studied to date. Methods: We performed a prospective study in patients with chronic kidney disease stage 1 - 5 (NCT00441623). Intestinal uptake of p-cresol, under steady state conditions, was estimated from 24 h urinary excretion of PCS. Primary endpoint was time to first cardiovascular event, i.e., cardiac death, myocardial infarction/ischemia, ventricular arrhythmia, cardiovascular surgery, ischemic stroke or symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. Statistical analysis was done using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazard analyses. Results: In a cohort of 200 patients, median 24 h urinary excretion of PCS amounted to 457.47 mu mol (IQR 252.68-697.17). After a median follow-up of 52 months, 25 patients reached the primary endpoint (tertile 1/2/3: 5/6/14 events, log rank P 0.037). Higher urinary excretion of PCS was directly associated with cardiovascular events (univariate hazard ratio per 100 mu mol increase: 1.112, P 0.002). In multivariate analysis, urinary excretion of PCS remained a predictor of cardiovascular events, independent of eGFR (hazard ratio 1.120, P 0.002). Conclusions: In patients with chronic kidney disease, intestinal uptake of p-cresol associates with cardiovascular disease independent of renal function. The intestinal generation and absorption of p-cresol may be therapeutic targets to reduce cardiovascular disease risk in patients with renal dysfunction.

"Generally, rainwater harvesting has been less acceptable as a stable water resource for the countries with large disparities in seasonal rainfall including Korea. In this study, rainwater harvesting system suitable for South Korea was investigated systematically. The simulation method utilizing daily rainfall data collected for the last 10 years was developed to determine the critical size of rainwater tank which could supply harvested rainwater continuously. The estimation of rainwater tank size was further simplified by developing a correlation of volume to area fractions. Extensive simulation was performed to evaluate the feasibility of rainwater harvesting for seven major cities in South Korea. The resulting rainwater tank was too large to be economically feasible, compared to daily harvested rainwater used. Thus, rainwater harvesting system was integrated with alternative water resources such as wastewater reclamation by membrane bioreactor (MBR) to enhance the applicability of rainwater harvesting without compromising continuous water supply.

"At present, China's grain production pattern runs counter to the distribution patterns of farmland resources and water-heat conditions. It is urgently important to conduct research on the spatial matching of grain production and farmland resources. Based on the Potential Crop Rotation data, with regards to the situations of irrigation and rain feeding, this paper builds a measuring model of potential farmland, and separately measures the spatial matching/index of grain yield with actual and potential farmland resources, thus revealing China's grain production pattern. The results indicate that serious spatial mismatch exists between grain production and farmland resources in China. Take the potential crop rotation system into consideration, the spatial mismatch of grain yield and potential farmland resources has been aggravated by the grain production barycenter's shift to the north China, with low Crop Rotation Index. The function-promoting regions of grain production in China are going through two evolution patterns of northward and southward expansion and westward movement and northward expansion, respectively. Inefficient use of farmland mainly occurs in the fragile ecological environments, such as the farming-pastoral ecotone of Northern China, the northwest area of Xinjiang and the southwest karst landform areas. The inefficient use of and the decreasing amount of available farmland have become the main causes of the decline in grain production. The problems facing Chinese agriculture caused by the spatial mismatch include the imbalance in regional structures, ecological risks, agricultural production risks, and the risk of food price. In order to cope with these problems, this paper provides some advices on protecting farmland acreage, expanding farmland potential, ensuring the safety of water resources, and extending the industrial grain chain. Our paper additionally proposes policy reforms and innovations designed to ensure the implementation of the above measures, so as to commonly defuse China's food security crisis.

"Biogas could provide a more sustainable energy source than wood fuels for rural households in sub-Saharan African. However, functioning of biogas digesters can be limited in areas of low water availability. The water required is approximately 50dm(3)day(-1) for each cow and 10dm(3)day(-1) for each pig providing manure to the digester, or 25 (+/- 6)dm(3)day(-1) for each person in the household, using a digester volume of 1.3 (+/- 0.3)m(3) capita(-1). Here, we consider the potential of domestic water recycling, rainwater harvesting, and aquaculture to supply the water needed for digestion in different countries of sub-Saharan Africa. Domestic water recycling was found to be important in every country but was usually insufficient to meet the requirements of the digester, with households in 72% of countries need to collect additional water. Rooftop rainwater harvesting also has an important role, iron roofs being more effective than thatched roofs at collecting water. However, even with an iron roof, the size of roof commonly found in sub-Saharan Africa (15 to 40m(2)) is too small to collect sufficient water, requiring an extra area (in m(2)) for each person of (R/100) (where R is the rainfall in mm). If there is a local market for fish, stocking a pond with tilapia, fed on plankton growing on bioslurry from the digester, could provide an important source of additional income and hold the water required by the digester. In areas where rainfall is low and seasonal, the fishpond might be stocked only in the rainy season, allowing the pond to be covered during the dry period to reduce evaporation. If evaporative losses (E in mm) exceed rainfall, an extra catchment area is needed to maintain the water level in the pond, equivalent to approximately (1.5x((E-R)/R))m(2) for each person in the household.

"Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social communication impairments and restricted, repetitive behaviors. Whereas current pharmacological interventions for ASD focus primarily on psychiatric symptoms, including agitation and obsessive behaviors, few agents target core symptomatology. It has been previously hypothesized that abnormalities in facial scanning, such as reduced eye contact or increased mouth fixation, contribute to social communication deficits in ASD. In addition, previous reports have suggested elevated stress and anxiety in ASD, symptoms that are believed to impact facial scanning patterns. Objectives: The present pilot study sought to explore the effects of pharmacological intervention via propranolol, a nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonist and known anxiolytic, on facial scanning in ASD. Specifically, we wished to determine whether there is an increase in eye contact and a decrease in mouth fixation with administration of propranolol. Method: A sample of 14 participants with ASD and 14 matched controls participated in two study sessions in which propranolol and placebo were administered in a counterbalanced, double-blinded manner. At each session, ocular fixation data were collected during presentation of video stimuli of 16 human faces. Fixation time on the eye, nose, and mouth regions of the face stimuli was analyzed. Results: The baseline fixation patterns for the ASD and control groups did not significantly differ; however, administration of propranolol was associated with a significant reduction in mouth fixation for the ASD group. Additionally, mouth fixation was positively related to nonverbal communication impairment in the ASD group. Conclusions: Although eye fixation in ASD appears typical in the present study, the effect of propranolol in reducing mouth fixation suggests an important focus for further research. Future studies are needed to better characterize the relationship between stress and anxiety and facial scanning in ASD, as well as the effects of pharmacological intervention.

"High therapeutic dosage requirements and the desire for ease of administration drive the trend to subcutaneous administration using delivery systems such as subcutaneous pumps and prefilled syringes. Because of dosage volume limits, prefilled syringe administration requires higher concentration liquid formulations, limited to about 30 cP or roughly 100-300 g L-1 for mAb's. Ultrafiltration (UF) processes are routinely used to formulate biological therapeutics. This article considers pressure constraints on the UF process that may limit its ability to achieve high final product concentrations. A system hardware analysis shows that the ultrafiltration cassette pressure drop is the major factor limiting UF systems. Additional system design recommendations are also provided. The design and performance of a new cassette with a lower feed channel flow resistance is described along with 3D modeling of feed channel pressure drop. The implications of variations in cassette flow channel resistance for scaling up and setting specifications are considered. A recommendation for a maximum pressure specification is provided. A review of viscosity data and theory shows that molecular engineering, temperature, and the use of viscosity modifying excipients including pH adjustment can be used to achieve higher concentrations. The combined use of a low pressure drop cassette with excipients further increased final concentrations by 35%. Guidance is provided on system operation to control hydraulics during final concentration. These recommendations should allow one to design and operate systems to routinely achieve the 30 cP target final viscosity capable of delivery using a pre-filled syringe.

"Goat production is an important agricultural activity in Jordan. The country is one of the poorest countries in the world in terms of water scarcity. Provision of sufficient quantity of good quality drinking water is important for goats to maintain feed intake and production. This study aimed to evaluate the seasonal availability and quality of goats' drinking water sources, accessibility, and utilization in different zones in the Karak Governorate in southern Jordan. Data collection methods comprised interviews with purposively selected farmers and quality assessment of water sources. The provision of drinking water was considered as one of the major constraints for goat production, particularly during the dry season (DS). Long travel distances to the water sources, waiting time at watering points, and high fuel and labor costs were the key reasons associated with the problem. All the values of water quality (WQ) parameters were within acceptable limits of the guidelines for livestock drinking WQ with exception of iron, which showed slightly elevated concentration in one borehole source in the DS. These findings show that water shortage is an important problem leading to consequences for goat keepers. To alleviate the water shortage constraint and in view of the depleted groundwater sources, alternative water sources at reasonable distance have to be tapped and monitored for water quality and more efficient use of rainwater harvesting systems in the study area is recommended.

"In recent years, model order reduction (MOR) of interconnect system has become an important technique to reduce the computation complexity and improve the verification efficiency in the nanometer VLSI design. The Krylov subspaces techniques in existing MOR methods are efficient, and have become the methods of choice for generating small-scale macro-models of the large-scale multi-port RCL networks that arise in VLSI interconnect analysis. Although the Krylov subspace projection-based MOR methods have been widely studied over the past decade in the electrical computer-aided design community, all of them do not provide a best optimal solution in a given order. In this paper, a minimum norm least-squares solution for MOR by Krylov subspace methods is proposed. The method is based on generalized inverse (or pseudo inverse) theory. This enables a new criterion for MOR-based Krylov subspace projection methods. Two numerical examples are used to test the PRIMA method based on the method proposed in this paper as a standard model.

"Little is known about the health effects of school-related indoor dampness and microbial exposures. In this study, we investigated dampness and dampness-related agents in both homes and schools and their association with allergy and respiratory health effects in 330 Danish pupils. Classroom dampness was identified based on technical inspection and bedroom dampness on parents' self-report. Classroom and bedroom dust was analyzed for seven microbial components. Skin prick testing determined atopic sensitization. Lung function was expressed as z-scores for forced expiratory volume in one-second (zFEV(1)), forced vital capacity (zFVC) and the ratio zFEV(1)/zFVC using GLI-2012 prediction equations. The parents reported children's allergies, airway symptoms, and doctor-diagnosed asthma. High classroom dampness, but not bedroom dampness, was negatively associated with zFEV(1) (-coef. -0.71; 95% CI -1.17 to -0.23) and zFVC (-coef. -0.52; 95% CI -0.98 to -0.06) and positively with wheezing (OR 8.09; 95% CI 1.49 to 43.97). No consistent findings were found between any individual microbial components or combination of microbial components and health outcomes. Among other indoor risk factors, environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) decreased zFEV(1) (-coef. -0.22; 95% CI -0.42 to -0.02) and zFEV(1)/zFVCratio (-coef. -0.26; 95% CI -0.44 to -0.07) and increased upper airway symptoms (OR 1.66; 95% CI 1.03-2.66). In conclusion, dampness in classrooms may have adverse respiratory health effects in pupils, but microbial agents responsible for this effect remain unknown.

"Sustainable water management is an important global action to alleviate the growing pressure on our water resources and a way to balance both socio-economic and environmental water needs. Irrigation of green roofs and other urban green infrastructures often has a negative connotation in a water management context. This is especially the case in semi-arid regions where both water scarcity during summer and other water needs compromise the public support of urban irrigation systems. However, irrigating green roofs is also beneficial as it improves plant survival and temperature control. Information on green roof irrigation is still very scarce, and this review attempts to draw attention to alternative water sources and water conservation strategies in order to make green roof irrigation practices more sustainable. Suggestions for more sustainable green roof irrigation showed that water can be conserved by adapting irrigation requirements (i.e. by targeting the vegetation or materials), by using alternative irrigation sources (e.g. gray water and rainwater harvesting) or by controlling and monitoring irrigation regimes. Based on the deficit irrigation strategy, irrigation specifications for green roofs in different climates were proposed. It became clear that irrigation is essential during establishment and the first growing season on all types of green roof and in all climates here considered. Afterwards, irrigation is necessary on green roofs in (semi)-arid climates, and advised in small amounts in the other climates. If public awareness of sustainable water consumption is promoted and if green roofs are designed carefully, then irrigation practices can be sustainable in the long term and contribute to better urban life quality.

"The TV-centric gaming concept creates an environment where people can play games with each other in the living room gathered around the TV screen. Games are controlled through mobile devices, using them not only as controllers, but also as personal screens for each player. The TV-centric gaming concept was hard to commercially deploy due to a lack of a common programming platform on the customer premise equipment. However, recent developments in TV operating systems may allow for rebooting the TV-centric gaming approach. This paper presents a proposal of integrating the TV-centric concept with a modern Internet TV based ecosystem, and a potential business case which regards Over-The-Top services as a means of deploying the concept in practice.

"Phylogeny is often used to compare entire families of genes/proteins. We previously showed that classification of Caenorhabditis elegans Rho GTPases on the basis of their enzymatic properties was significantly different from sequence alignments. To further develop this concept, we have developed an integrated approach to classify C. elegans small GTPases based on functional data comprising affinity for GTP, sub-cellular localization, tissue distribution and silencing impact. This analysis led to establish a novel functional classification for small GTPases. To test the relevance of this classification in mammals, we focused our attention on the human orthologs of small GTPases from a specific group comprising arf- 1.2, evl-20, arl-1, Y54E10BR. 2, unc-108 and rab-7. We then tested their involvement in protein secretion and membrane traffic in mammalian systems. Using this approach we identify a novel network containing 18 GTPases, and 23 functionally interacting proteins, conserved between C. elegans and mammals, which is involved in membrane traffic and protein secretion.

"This work analyse the movements and the muscular activity during motocross sessions and how a neck brace influence both. These movements are measured in terms of angles using two Biometrics (R) angular sensors (one for bi-planar flexion and one for torsion); the muscle activity is registered using four pairs of electrodes (muscle selected: Sterno-Cleido-Mastoid left and right, Trapezium left and right). From the results obtained, we can conclude that the pilot wants to focus the attention to the next jump or obstacle while accelerations of different nature are acting on the neck, therefore isometric contractions are predominant. The fact that the brace did not reduce the rotational range of motion is a positive result because the pilot field of view is not modified which is a safety requirement. According to the evidence of a fatigue effect, the brace is useful not only to protect the pilot during accidents but also as a supporting device during driving sessions. (C) 2013 The Authors.

"Background: Time-lapse microscopy is an essential tool for capturing and correlating bacterial morphology and gene expression dynamics at single-cell resolution. However state-of-the-art computational methods are limited in terms of the complexity of cell movies that they can analyze and lack of automation. The proposed Bacterial image analysis driven Single Cell Analytics (BaSCA) computational pipeline addresses these limitations thus enabling high throughput systems microbiology. Results: BaSCA can segment and track multiple bacterial colonies and single-cells, as they grow and divide over time (cell segmentation and lineage tree construction) to give rise to dense communities with thousands of interacting cells in the field of view. It combines advanced image processing and machine learning methods to deliver very accurate bacterial cell segmentation and tracking (F-measure over 95%) even when processing images of imperfect quality with several overcrowded colonies in the field of view. In addition, BaSCA extracts on the fly a plethora of single-cell properties, which get organized into a database summarizing the analysis of the cell movie. We present alternative ways to analyze and visually explore the spatiotemporal evolution of single-cell properties in order to understand trends and epigenetic effects across cell generations. The robustness of BaSCA is demonstrated across different imaging modalities and microscopy types. Conclusions: BaSCA can be used to analyze accurately and efficiently cell movies both at a high resolution (single-cell level) and at a large scale (communities with many dense colonies) as needed to shed light on e.g. how bacterial community effects and epigenetic information transfer play a role on important phenomena for human health, such as biofilm formation, persisters' emergence etc. Moreover, it enables studying the role of single-cell stochasticity without losing sight of community effects that may drive it.

"United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6 targets access to water and sanitation for all people in the next 15 years. However, for developing countries such as Nepal, it is more challenging to achieve this goal given its poor infrastructure and high population growth. To assess the water crisis in the most developed and populated area of Nepal, the Kathmandu Valley, we estimated available water resources and domestic water demand in the valley. We estimated a supply deficit of 102 million liters per day (MLD) in 2016, after completion of the first phase of the Melamchi Water Supply Project (MWSP). If the MWSP is completed within the specified timeframe, and sufficient treatment and distribution infrastructure is developed, then there would be no water deficit by 2023-2025. This indicates that the MWSP will make a significant contribution to the valley's water security. However, emphasis must be given to utilizing all of the water available from the MWSP by developing sufficient water treatment and distribution infrastructure. Alternate mitigation options, such as planning land use for potential recharge, introducing micro- to macro-level rainwater harvesting structures, conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources, and water demand-side management, would also be helpful.

"The starting point in choosing this theme was the belief that in the specific professional sports instructive activity the dominant form of communication is the nonverbal communication in the coach-athlete relationship, with implications for the improvement of the training process. The study consisted in a sociological approach through an inquiry conducted on a group of athletes. The questionnaire comprised items with prefigured and open answers to facilitate the research in the female gymnasts of the Vasile Alecsandri University of Bacau team. A dominant form of expressing in the sports training is represented by body movements as an expression of energy and information through posture, movement and indices, a psycho-somatic connection (body-soul) through which feelings and emotions are expressed. The gestures of illustration, the artifacts, the facial expressing are other landmarks of the existence of nonverbal communication perceived by the athletes in the sports training process. The body language communication is perceived by most respondents, the messages transmitted this way being continuous, facilitating a dialog between the coach and the female gymnast.

"The sudden impact of a free surface flow upon a solid wall is a common occurrence in many situations in nature and technology. The design of marine structures is probably the most obvious example, but also river and dam hydraulics as well as the necessity of understanding flood and debris flow-induced damage have led to theoretical and experimental work on the mechanism of fluid slamming loads. This is therefore a very old and rich research field, which has not yet reached full maturity, so that semi-empirical methods in design practice are still the rule in many sectors. Up-to-date CFD technology with both Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches is employed to investigate highly non-stationary fluid impact on a solid wall. The development of the pressure wave produced by the impact is examined as it propagates and interacts with the fluid boundaries, as well as the subsequent build-up of high-pressure gradients of high fluid velocities. The geometry and the velocity field of the problem considered are very simple, but the results seem to provide new insight, in particular, into the connection between phenomena with different timescales.

"Purpose The aim of this study was to investigate homophobic attitudes in three European countries: Italy, Albania, and Ukraine. One thousand and forty-eight students were recruited in Italian (n = 766), Albanian (n = 180), and Ukrainian (n = 102) university centers. Methods A socio-demographic questionnaire and Homophobia Scale (HS) were administered by our staff. Results Cross-cultural and significant differences among Italian, Albanian, and Ukrainian students were found on the Homophobia Scale (HS; Italy: mean = 22.26 +/- 16.73; Albania: mean = 38.15 +/- 17.28; Ukraine: mean = 59.18 +/- 16.23). The analysis of sociodemographic characteristics revealed that the male gender emerged as main predictor of homophobic attitude in all the three countries, although also a conservative political orientation and the religious belief predict higher homophobia levels in Italy and Albania, particularly. Conclusions This study revealed that in these European countries assessed, attitudes toward homosexuality are different. Ukrainians display higher levels of homophobia than Albanians and Italians, confirming the central role of cultural differences in homophobic attitudes. Nevertheless, some socio-demographic aspects such as identification as male have a similar influence on homophobic attitudes in all assessed populations.

"Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stem cells (WJMSCs) are being increasingly recognized for their ectodermal differentiation potential. Previously, we demonstrated that when WJMSC were seeded onto an acellular matrix material derived from Wharton's jelly and cultured in osteogenic induction media, generated CK19 positive cells and hair-like structures indicative of ectodermal differentiation of WJMSCs. In this manuscript, we examine the underlying mechanism behind this observation using a variety of microscopy and molecular biology techniques such as western blotting and qPCR. We demonstrate that these hair-like structures are associated with live cells that are positive for epithelial and mesenchymal markers such as cytokeratin-19 and alpha-smooth muscle actin, respectively. We also show that up regulation of beta-catenin and noggin, along with the expression of TGF-beta and SMAD and inhibition of BMP4 could be the mechanism behind this ectodermal differentiation and hair-like structure formation.

"The research on boundary-layer receptivity is the key issue for the laminarturbulent transition prediction in fluid mechanics. Many of the previous studies for local receptivity are on the basis of the parallel flow assumption which cannot accurately reflect the real physics. To overcome this disadvantage, local receptivity in the non-parallel boundary layer is studied in this paper by the direct numerical simulation (DNS). The difference between the non-parallel and parallel boundary layers on local receptivity is investigated. In addition, the effects of the disturbance frequency, the roughness location, and the multiple roughness elements on receptivity are also determined. Besides, the relations of receptivity with the amplitude of free-stream turbulence (FST), with the roughness height, and with the roughness length are ascertained as well. The Tollmien- Schlichting (T-S) wave packets are excited in the non-parallel boundary layer under the interaction of the FST and the localized wall roughness. A group of T-S waves are separated by the fast Fourier transform. The obtained results are in accordance with Dietz's measurements, Wu's theoretical calculations, and the linear stability theory (LST).

"The Internet of Things is the natural continuity of the Ambient Intelligence where smart and ambient environments are built mainly by integrating a large number of interconnected smart objects (sensors, actuators, Smartphone, appliances, etc.) with heterogeneous capabilities abstracted as software services. These services can be composed on the fly and provided, all the time and everywhere, to assist users in their daily activities. A key issue in user-centered services composition is to intelligently and effectively discover and select the most relevant services that best match the users' requirements and closely meet the specified quality-of-service level. Monitoring seamlessly the provided services and enhancing their quality, is still a challenging issue due mainly to the dynamicity and uncertainty characterizing ambient environments. In this paper, we propose a new service-oriented, user-centered and event-aware Framework capable of performing services monitoring to handle automatically events that may occur in ambient environments. This monitoring is based on a dynamic services discovery and selection process to enhance self-adaptation to unpredicted changes, and ensure services continuity with best quality. The overall proposed Framework has been implemented and validated through a scenario dedicated to daily activity recognition in an Ambient-Assisted Living environment. In addition, the obtained performances from extensive tests show clearly the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed approach in the case of a large-scale environment.

"Scene text information extraction plays an important role in many computer vision applications. Most features in existing text extraction algorithms are only applicable to one text extraction stage (text detection or recognition), which significantly weakens the consistency in an end-to-end system, especially for the complex Chinese texts. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose a novel text structure feature extractor based on a text structure component detector (TSCD) layer and residual network for Chinese texts. Inspired by the three-layer Chinese text cognition model of a human, we combine the TSCD layer and the residual network to extract features suitable for both text extraction stages. The specialized modeling for Chinese characters in the TSCD layer simulates the key structure component cognition layer in the psychological model. And the residual mechanism in the residual network simulates the key bidirectional connection among the layers in the psychological model. Through the organic combination of the TSCD layer and the residual network, the extracted features are applicable to both text detection and recognition, as humans do. In evaluation, both text detection and recognition models based on our proposed text structure feature extractor achieve great improvements over baseline CNN models. And an end-to-end Chinese text information extraction system is experimentally designed and evaluated, showing the advantage of the proposed feature extractor as a unified feature extractor.

"Geosynthetics, including geogrids and geotextiles, have been extensively used for stabilisation and soil reinforcement in several geotechnical structures, such as foundations, abutments, walls and slopes. In these applications, soil-geosynthetic interaction plays a determinant role. This paper describes an experimental study carried out using a large-scale pullout test apparatus, aiming to investigate the pullout behaviour of different geosynthetics embedded in a granite residual soil. The study involved two geogrids (one biaxial and the other uniaxial), one geocomposite reinforcement (high-strength geotextile) and one geotextile. The soil was compacted to different relative densities. Test results have revealed that soil-geosynthetic interaction under pullout loading conditions is highly influenced by the geosynthetic properties and soil density. Regardless of soil density, the biaxial geogrid exhibited higher pullout resistance than the other geosynthetics. At maximum pullout force, the deformation along the length of the geotextiles was considerably more pronounced than that along the geogrids. For the conditions adopted in this study, the soil-geosynthetic pullout interaction coefficients ranged from .25 to .52. In general, the values of the scale effect correction factor obtained for the geotextiles were slightly lower than the value recommended by the Federal Highway Administration in the absence of test data.

"The present paper focuses on how nonverbal communication elements are correlated with leadership behaviours of military junior leaders and how these constructs affect the superior performance of their followers. Our data show that the facial expression (smile) and the eye behaviour are the ones that have a positive and most pronounced correlation with the subordinate's perception of self-confidence, self-control, courage, empathy, and influence / reference of their commanders. The factors extraordinary effort and satisfaction are also positively related. On the contrary, gestures such as crossed arms and point one's finger have a negative correlation with the subordinate's perception of self-confidence, self-control, courage, empathy, and influence /reference of their commanders. In this case, the factors extraordinary effort and satisfaction are also negatively related. We conclude that the use of certain gestures may contribute to a positive or negative perception of a commander by his followers thereby influencing their performance.

"Important energy reductions can be achieved in the building sector by providing occupants with feedback about their energy-consumption levels. Recent studies link the success of energy-feedback methods to the level of occupant engagement with people in their social circles and the resulting peer pressure to conform to certain social norms. Despite promising results, the literature remains limited in scope to individual rather than groups of buildings. This has limited the design of feedback initiatives leveraging social connections that exist, or that can be induced, within and between buildings. The current paper addresses the identified gap by proposing a multilayer agent-based model that serves as a test bed to simulate and optimize feedback methods applied on any building stock (e.g.,community and city). Monte Carlo and sensitivity analyses show that connecting occupants of different buildings, while increasing their engagement with the feedback mechanism, can lead to energy reductions exceeding 10%. The findings confirm the role of social networks in energy-conservation diffusion, setting the stage for large-scale and socially engaging energy-conservation initiatives.

"The last climatic years have recorded a recrudescence of risk phenomena, especially floods and droughts. Because of this reason an acute shortage of water is presently felt even in the mountainous areas. Hydrological data have been recorded at 5 gauges distributed in the middle and lowers sectors of the basin. Suha river basin includes a large number of inhabitants, attracted here some time ago by mining exploitations. The closing of Ostra mine has not led to a decrease in population, and thus water demands are higher and higher and underground resources are used. Minimum discharge in the basin is extremely low in comparison to the reality of other mountain catchments (at Stulpicani gauge a mean minimum discharge of 0.611 m(3)/s has been recorded during 1970-2013). This situation is due first of all to the rapid infiltration of water in the very permeable deposits (sands, gravels, boulders). An increase in water demands is probable if the comfort of the dwellings is improved by raising the number of baths and showers, of greenhouses for vegetables growing, of guest-houses with pools etc. In order to preserve water resources in the area is imposed the keeping of the present forested surfaces and the adequate control of tailings dumps so as to avoid underground and surface water pollution. Due to practices like toilets lacking septic tanks or gathering of manure on un-isolated platforms, the conservation of present water quality (especially the underground one) is imperious.

"Introduction/Objective Digital 3D modeling is slowly becoming an everyday orthodontic practice, and after two decades of research and development it is a basic element of e-orthodontics. The aim of this study was development and use of geometric entities on 3D digital models for diagnosing, planning and monitoring of orthodontic therapy, by using CAD (computer aided design) systems. Methods Statistical analysis and synthesis of 54 orthodontic parameters (28 in the upper and 26 in the lower jaw), defining three hypotheses and their testing, the application of the t-test. Results All three hypotheses are confirmed, convenience of using geometric entities, higher accuracy of 3D digital models, and more substantial displacement of teeth in the first six months of therapy (Student's t-test). After the first six months, distances in the x-y plane (occlusal plane) were bigger in both the upper and the lower jaw; additionally, the distances in the y-z plane (medial plane) decreased on the left and right side, so we can say that the first phase of therapy had success and that both jaws are wider. At the next four controls, parameters showed slight progress that was not statistically significant. Overall, after 11 months of therapy, there was a considerable improvement in the x-y plane, while changes in distances of clinical crown heights were very small. This could be explained by the fact that, during therapy, by using different arches, upper molars were pushed inside, toward the palate. Analyzing 3D computer models, we could notice that in this plane displacement of the upper left first molar was larger. Conclusion The use of geometric entities for defining orthodontic parameters gives us new possibilities for accurate and reliable analysis of patient's orthodontic condition.

The aim was to provide a comprehensive overview of potential incentives for using AAL technologies. The data was coded using the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT). In total 13 incentives could be identified, which were grouped into six categories: (1) social incentives, (2) health and safety incentives, (3) activity incentives, (4) novel sensory incentives, (5) status incentives and (6) self-reactive incentives. Within these categories 'social connectedness' and 'health and safety' were the most important incentives. These results provide a comprehensive and theoretically grounded understanding of what motivates older adults to adopt AAL technologies.

"Previous studies show that close friends improve at lie detection over time. However, is this improvement due to an increase in the ability to decode the feelings of close friends or a change in how close friends communicate their true and deceptive emotions? In a study of 45 pairs of friends, one friend from each pair (the sender) was videotaped showing truthful and faked affect in response to pleasant and unpleasant movie clips. The other friend from each pair (the judge) guessed the true emotions of both the friend and a stranger 1 month and 6 months into the friendship. Judges were better at guessing the true emotions of friends than strangers, and this advantage in judging friends increased among close friends over time. Surprisingly, improvement over time was due mostly to a change in the sender's communication, rather than an increase in judges' ability to decode their friends' feelings.

"Despite their nutritional value, population-level nut consumption remains low. Studies suggest that individuals would eat more nuts on their doctor's advice, making health professionals potentially important for promoting nut consumption. This cross-sectional study aimed to examine the perceptions and knowledge of nuts and the predictors of nut promotion among health professionals in New Zealand. Dietitians, general practitioners (GPs), and practice nurses were identified from the Electoral Roll and invited to complete a questionnaire (n = 318, 292, and 149 respondents respectively). Over one-fifth of GPs and practice nurses believed that eating nuts could increase blood cholesterol concentrations and cause weight gain. The most common perceptions overall were that nuts are healthy; high in protein, fat, and calories; and are satiating. Nut consumption was recommended for reasons relating to these perceptions and because of nuts' selenium content. Conversely, reasons for suggesting the consumption of fewer nuts included that they were high in calories and fat, would cause weight gain, and concerns regarding allergies and cost. All groups of health professionals were more likely to promote nut consumption if they perceived nuts to reduce the risk of diabetes (all p <= 0.034). Education could improve health professionals' knowledge regarding the effects of nut consumption on blood cholesterol and body weight, alongside other health benefits, which should improve the advice given to patients and may thereby increase nut consumption.

"Neuropathic pain is a debilitating chronic pain condition occurring after damage in the nervous system and is refractory to the currently available treatments. Major challenges include elucidating its mechanisms and developing new medications to treat it. Nerve injury-induced pain hypersensitivity involves aberrant excitability in spinal dorsal horn (SDH) neurons as a consequence of dysfunction of inhibitory interneurons and of hyperactivity of glial cells, especially microglia, the immune cells of the central nervous system. Evidence of this is found using animal models to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms of neuropathic pain. The pathologically altered somatosensory signals in the SDH then convey to the brain regions, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). In these regions, nerve injury produces pre- and postsynaptic long-term plasticity, which contributes to negative emotions and anxiety associated with chronic pain conditions. Furthermore, recent evidence also indicates that the descending projection pathways from the ACC directly and indirectly to the SDH (the top-down corticospinal network) regulate nociceptive sensory transmission in the SDH. Thus, understanding a possible connection between the SDH and ACC, including a neuron-microglia interaction, may provide us with insights into the mechanisms used to amplify pain signals related to neuropathic pain and clues to aid the development of new therapeutic agents for the management of chronic pain.

"Scope: Xanthohumol (XN) is a bioactive prenylflavonoid from hops. A single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) study was conducted in men (n = 24) and women (n = 24) to determine dose-concentration relationships. Methods and results: Subjects received a single oral dose of 20, 60, or 180 mg XN. Blood was collected at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h. Plasma levels of XN and its metabolites, isoxanthohumol (IX), 8-prenylnaringenin (8PN), and 6-prenylnaringenin (6PN) were measured by LC-MS/MS. Xanthohumol (XN) and IX conjugates were dominant circulating flavonoids among all subjects. Levels of 8PN and 6PN were undetectable in most subjects. The XN PK profile showed peak concentrations around 1 h and between 4-5 h after ingestion. The maximum XN concentrations (C-max) were 33 +/- 7 mg/L, 48 +/- 11 mg/L, and 120 +/- 24 mg/L for the 20, 60, and 180 mg dose, respectively. Using noncompartmental modeling, the area under the curves (AUC(0 ->infinity)) for XN were 92 +/- 68 h x mu g/L, 323 +/- 160 h x mu g/L, and 863 +/- 388 h x mu g/L for the 20, 60, and 180 mg dose, respectively. The mean half-life of XN was 20 h for the 60 and 18 h for the 180 mg dose. Conclusion: XN has a distinct biphasic absorption pattern with XN and IX conjugates being the major circulating metabolites.

"This paper addresses the effectiveness of geocell mattress prepared with waste plastic bottles with fly ash as a filling material overlying soft clay bed through laboratory model tests. The test beds were subjected to loading by means of a square rigid steel plate as a footing. The effect of height and width of geocell mattress as well as basal bamboo geogrid underneath geocell mattress on overall performance of the system in terms of footing pressure, settlement, and the adjacent surface deformation (heave/settlement) has been systematically studied through a series of tests. Test results indicate around twofold increases in the bearing pressure by placing a jute geotextile separator beneath the unreinforced fly ash bed, whereas reinforcing the fly ash bed with geocell mattress in presence of a basal bamboo geogrid and jute geotextile separator can produce sevenfold increases in the footing pressure. Inclusion of a basal bamboo geogrid improves overall behavior of the reinforced bed. No surface deformation occurred in the unreinforced beds. Inclusion of a geocell mattress improves the footing pressure, but creates surface deformation (heave/settlement). Increase in height as well as width of geocell mattress not only diminishes the surface heaving but also increases the footing pressure. As the present study carries limitation of boundary and scale effects, the quantitative results must be extrapolated by dimensional analysis before use in practical applications or a field study is required. However, the qualitative results encourage the use of waste plastic bottles for soft ground improvement, which in turn may solve the disposal issue to a certain extent.

"As the prevalence of embedded systems in various fields has spread, real-time operating systems (RTOSs) have been widely used for many years satisfying real-time requirements and a multitasking design. The use of RTOS adds additional overhead to a system, which should be deliberately considered and evaluated in some critical systems. This paper presents a qualitative and quantitative comparison between an open-source RTOS (FreeRTOS V8.0.0) and a commercial one (mu C/OS-III). Both RTOS use a preemptive multitasking kernel, with additional support for round robin scheduling. We aim to benchmark and evaluate their performance and behaviour, including seven performance tests and two behaviour tests. Comparing the measurement results shows that the commercial mu C/OS-III does not behave much better than FreeRTOS. Furthermore, we discovered that the priority changing function of mu C/OSIII does not behave correctly in some circumstances. Although FreeRTOS has no such problem in the latest version, it still has a problem with its dynamic memory management.

"Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by many cell types in both normal and pathogenic circumstances. Because EVs, particularly exosomes, are known to transfer biologically active proteins, RNAs and lipids between cells, they have recently become the focus of intense interest as potential mediators of cell-cell communication, particularly in long-range and juxtacrine signaling events associated with adaptive immune function and progression of cancer. Among the EVs, exosomes appear particularly adapted for long-range delivery of cargoes between cells. Because of their association with disease states, the exciting potential for exosomes to serve as diagnostic biomarkers and as target-specific biomolecule delivery vehicles has stimulated a broad range of biomedical investigations to learn how exosomes are generated, what their cargoes are, and how they might be tailored for uptake by remote targets. Addressing these questions requires experimental models in which biochemically useful amounts of material can be harvested, gene expression easily manipulated, and interpretable biological assays developed. The early Xenopus embryo fulfills these model-system ideals in an in vivo context: during morphogenesis the embryo develops several large, fluid-filled extracellular compartments across which numerous tissue-specifying signals must cross, and which are abundantly endowed with exosomes and other EVs. Importantly, certain surface-facing tissues avidly ingest EVs during gastrulation. Recent work has demonstrated that EVs can be isolated from these interstitial spaces in amounts suitable for proteomic and transcriptomic analysis. With its large numbers, great cell size, well-understood fate map, and tolerance of a variety of experimental approaches, the Xenopus embryo provides a unique opportunity to both understand and manipulate the basic cell biology of exosomal trafficking in the context of an intact organism.

"Objectives: Motivation to change behavior is an important therapeutic factor that affects treatment outcomes in patients with substance-use disorders. The motivation level influences treatment engagement, retention, and outcomes. Assessment of motivation is an important aspect of management of these patients. Methods: A total of 26 patients admitted in Kasr Al-Ainy Addiction Unit fulfilling Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition criteria of one or more substance dependence disorder were included. Patients were assessed using the Stage of change readiness and the treatment-eagerness scale (SOCRATES) and Addiction Severity Index before attending 4 motivation-incentives group psychotherapy sessions: 1 session/week. Patients were reassessed using SOCRATES after the sessions. Results: SOCRATES increased 3 scales after the motivationincentives groups; however, recognition and ambivalence scales showed significant increase (P= 0.005 and 0.012, respectively), whereas the increase in the taking steps scale was not statistically significant, with P= 0.125. A best-fit model of regression was calculated for factors thatmaypredictSOCRATES before the group. Age of the patient, education years, main substance of abuse (either tramadol or other substances), history of suicide, previous treatment trial, positive or negative medical history, history of alcohol use, history of legal problems, presence of family issues, and psychiatric complications were predictors of the recognition, ambivalence, and taking steps components of motivation. Conclusions: Short-motivation incentives group therapy may improve the readiness to change in patients with polysubstance dependence.

"The mental well-being of the world's adolescents has decreased in the last 20-30 years. Such a trend is visible also in Sweden, a country otherwise considered a positive example in terms of child well-being. In Sweden, students in lower secondary school are especially exposed. From a salutogenic orientation, this study qualitatively explored 200 Swedish students' (grades 5-9) perceptions of the role of happiness in school. Students perceived happiness as both promoting and being promoted by five aspects: learning, school engagement, appreciation of subjects or lesson content, others' happiness, and prosocial behavior. Hence, five perceived bidirectional crossovers of subjective well-being were found. These were compared to the findings of previous research about the determinants and effects of happiness. The students' perceptions both add new direction for future research and align in several respects with decades of earlier research.

"The skin can serve as an interstitial Na+ reservoir. Local tissue Na+ accumulation increases with age, inflammation and infection. This increased local Na+ availability favors pro-inflammatory immune cell function and dampens their anti-inflammatory capacity. In this review, we summarize available data on how NaCl affects various immune cells. We particularly focus on how salt promotes pro-inflammatory macrophage and T cell function and simultaneously curtails their regulatory and anti-inflammatory potential. Overall, these findings demonstrate that local Na+ availability is a promising novel regulator of immunity. Hence, the modulation of tissue Na+ levels bears broad therapeutic potential: increasing local Na+ availability may help in treating infections, while lowering tissue Na+ levels may be used to treat, for example, autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases.

"This paper addresses the problem of identifying different flow environments from sparse data collected by wing strain sensors. Insects regularly perform this feat using a sparse ensemble of noisy strain sensors on their wing. First, we obtain strain data from numerical simulation of a Manduca sexta hawkmoth wing undergoing different flow environments. Our data-driven method learns low-dimensional strain features originating from different aerodynamic environments using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) modes in the frequency domain, and leverages sparse approximation to classify a set of strain frequency signatures using a dictionary of POD modes. This bio-inspired machine learning architecture for dictionary learning and sparse classification permits fewer costly physical strain sensors while being simultaneously robust to sensor noise. A measurement selection algorithm identifies frequencies that best discriminate the different aerodynamic environments in low-rank POD feature space. In this manner, sparse and noisy wing strain data can be exploited to robustly identify different aerodynamic environments encountered in flight, providing insight into the stereotyped placement of neurons that act as strain sensors on a Manduca sexta hawkmoth wing.

"Three genes, gnd, pgl, and fbp, relevant to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) were overexpressed in Corynebacterium glutamicum IWJ001, leading to increase of L-isoleucine production. The transcriptional levels of gnd, pgl, and fbp significantly increased in IWJ001/pDXW-8-gnd-fbp-pgl. Compared with the control strain IWJ001/pDXW-8, intracellular NADPH/NADP(+) ratios in IWJ001/pDXW-8-gnd and IWJ001/pDXW-8-gnd-fbp cells grown for 36 H increased threefold and fourfold, respectively, indicating that overexpression of gnd and fbp redirected the carbon flux to PPP. Intracellular NADPH/NADP(+) ratio in IWJ001/pDXW-8-gnd-fbp-pgl grown for 36 H was similar to IWJ001/pDXW-8, suggesting that the NADPH produced by PPP could be quickly consumed for L-isoleucine production. 10.9 and 28.96 g/L of L-isoleucine was produced in IWJ001/pDXW-8-gnd-fbp-pgl in shake flask cultivation and fed-batch fermentation, respectively. In addition, IWJ001/pDXW-8-gnd-fbp-pgl grew fast, its dry cell weight reached 49 g/L after 48 H, whereas the start strain IWJ001/pDXW-8 reached only 40 g/L. After 96 H fermentation, L-isoleucine yield on glucose in IWJ001/pDXW-8-gnd-fbp-pgl reached 0.138 g/g. The results demonstrate that carbon flux redirection to PPP is an efficient approach to enhance L-isoleucine production in C. glutamicum.

"Background: Exposure to multiple types of air pollution may contribute to and exacerbate allergic diseases including asthma and wheezing. However, few studies have examined chronic air pollution exposure and allergic disease outcomes among an adult population. Associations between potential estimates of annual average fine particulate matter (PM2.5), traffic related air pollution, and industrial source air emissions and three allergic disease outcomes (asthma, allergies and wheezing) were examined in a state-wide general population of adults. Methods: The study includes a representative sample of 3381 adult Wisconsin residents who participated in the 2008-2013 Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW) program. Participant data were geographically linked to The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Baysian space-time downscaler air pollution model for PM2.5, the United States Census roadway, and USEPA's Toxic Release Inventory data. Self-report and lung function (FEV1) estimates were used to define prevalence of asthma, allergies and wheezing symptoms. Results: Annual mean exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) was between 6.59 and 15.14 mu g/m(3). An increase of 5 mu g/m(3) in the annual mean PM2.5 resulted in a 3.58 (2.36, 5.43) increase in the adjusted odds (95% CI) of having asthma. Exposure to vehicle traffic increased the odds of both current allergies [OR (95% CI)=1.35 (1.07, 1.35)] and current asthma [OR (95% CI)=1.51 (1.14, 2.00)]. Living within 300 m of an Interstate roadway was associated with a 3-fold increase in the odds of asthma. Those living within 800 m of an industrial site were 47% more likely to have asthma. No significant associations were seen with wheezing. Conclusions: Within this population exposed to overall annual average levels of estimated low level chronic exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) at or near 12 mu g/m(3), the USEPA standard for air quality, significant association between both modeled PM2.5 exposure and proximity to roadways with asthma and allergies but not wheezing were found. Industrial source emissions were not associated with any allergic disease outcomes.

However, the utilization of non-encapsulated PCM is one of the main gaps. The main objective of this work was the study of physical and mechanical properties of cement mortars with incorporation of non-encapsulated PCM. It was possible to conclude that the utilization of non-encapsulated phase change materials can be seen as a good and more economical solution for the energy efficiency of the buildings, without prejudice of the properties.

"In this paper, a fundamentally new approach to computer-aided design and simulation of electrical circuits based on a use of lambda-calculus for circuit device model representation and dynamic sizeable containers for sparse matrix simulation indexation indices is presented. This approach differs from traditional procedure where the entire simulation was performed over the matrix or matrix system assembled by modified nodal analysis (MNA). Turning device model definitions using lambda-calculus to functionals allowed to reduce an effort required for their specification and opened new possibilities for simulation evaluation. Considering MNA matrix as second-order tensor system holding the functional definition of original sparse matrix entries allows to imagine these dependencies as chains with respect to a model definition and global dependencies between their defining inner functions. In this particular case, standard indexing methods would be a waste of memory during a computation, this problem occurs when huge sparse matrices enter the simulation. Therefore, new optimized indexing technique for non-zero matrix entries and variable size container types for those indexation vectors is proposed.

"Purpose of review This review provides an update and summary of recent neuropsychological findings in epilepsy focusing on three major clinical topics among the many developments in the field. We will critically outline the current state with regard to cognition in new-onset epilepsies, social cognition in epilepsy, and the long-term outcome of epilepsy surgery and the cognitive outcomes of superselective surgical procedures. Recent findings Current studies indicate that neuropsychological impairments are prevalent already at the onset of epilepsy and even before, social cognition (i.e., emotion recognition and theory of mind) is impaired in different epilepsy populations, the long-term outcome of epilepsy surgery is mostly characterized by a stable or even improved cognitive status, and superselective epilepsy surgeries are associated with a promising neuropsychological outcome. Summary The high prevalence of cognitive deficits around epilepsy onset challenges the assumption that epilepsy is the major cause of cognitive problems and calls for early neuropsychological diagnostics. Social cognition seems to be a relevant domain that is not yet routinely considered in epilepsy. The cognitive long-term outcome of epilepsy surgery is mostly positive. Stereotactic thermocoagulation and gamma knife surgery appear to be cognitively safe procedures.

"Contact resistance between interlaced conductive yarns will under certain circumstances constitute a problem for sensor applications and electrical routing in interactive textile structures. This type of resistance could alter the effective area of the sensor and introduce hot-spots in the routing. This paper presents a technique for measuring contact resistances on fabric samples. The samples used are unit cells of plain weave, that is, two conductive (silver-coated) yarns in the warp direction and two in the weft direction. The numerical values for the contact resistance are of the order of R-c approximate to 0.3. A resistor network made of through-hole film resistors with known values is used for evaluation of the method. The results show that the technique provides values typically within +/- 1% error compared with the known resistor values. Thus, the method can be used in order to calculate the contact resistances of a woven conductive textile.

"The accuracy of imaging for bulk volume estimation of apple slices in the process of drying at temperatures from 40 to 80 degrees C was investigated and compared with physical caliper measurements. The initial hypothesis was to estimate bulk volume of cylindrically shaped apple slices from diameter and thickness imaging. Imaging of diameter showed strong agreement with caliper measurements throughout the entire drying process, however imaging of thickness was not accurate due to the irregular shrinkage and bending phenomena. A linear model reflecting the relationship between diameter and bulk volume was developed and validated at temperatures of 40, 60, and 80 degrees C. It showed good correlation between imaging diameter and bulk volume changes in the range of moisture contents from 9.1 to 0.25 g/g. The relative percentage error of the prediction model was approximately 6.45%, which suggests that imaging can be used as a robust tool for bulk volume estimation of apple slices during convective drying.

"In this work we present and analyze three approaches for the adaptive control of the operating point of a cascade of erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs), aimed at optical networks performance enhancement. The first approach is called Annealing Search Heuristic with Backpropagation and flexible output (AsHB flex) and uses machine learning concepts to update the amplifier gains through an iterative process. The second one (Exhaustive Method) uses an exhaustive search to evaluate all possible solutions for the problem and obtain the optimum solution. The last one (MaxGain) is a heuristic method that uses previous knowledge about the problem to obtain the solutions. The amplifier characteristics and specifications were obtained experimentally through measurements of gain, noise figure, gain ripple and power consumption on commercially available EDFAs. We performed comparisons among these approaches and others found in the literature, and the results show that the three proposals outperformed the previous ones in terms of noise figure, gain ripple and BER. For example, in a link with four amplifiers the Exhaustive Method achieved a reduction in the cascade noise figure from 10.05 to 5.18 dB, a reduction in the gain ripple from 24.08 to 18.56 dB and a reduction in the BER in almost two orders of magnitude, when compared with the traditional approach, which defines the gain to compensate the loss of the previous link. However, the computation time of Exhaustive Method becomes prohibitive as the number of amplifiers in the link increases. Both MaxGain and AsHBflex obtained similar solutions, close to the optimum operation point in a reasonable time.

"This paper explores the performance of a DC-DC converter based with current mode controller photovoltaic (PV) simulator which emulates the output characteristics of a real PV module. A portable PV simulator prototype of 85 W is examined in terms of its steady state IV curve matching capacity and the convergence time corresponding to step change in current source load, voltage source load, and insolation levels. The current voltage (IV) characteristics of the PV module are implemented as a look-up-table (LUT) which determines the reference output current from measured output voltage. A Thevenin Equivalent Method approach to PV arrays analysis is also included in order to model the small-signal linearized characteristics. Extensive simulation results obtained in MAT LAB are included to show that the PV simulator can work in most situations as a real PV module. Preliminary experimental results verify performance with current-source and voltage-source loads

"The California sea lion (Zalophus californianus), is an agile and powerful swimmer. Unlike many successful swimmers (dolphins, tuna), they generate most of their thrust with their large foreflippers. This protocol describes a robotic platform designed to study the hydrodynamic performance of the swimming California sea lion (Zalophus californianus). The robot is a model of the animal's foreflipper that is actuated by motors to replicate the motion of its propulsive stroke (the 'clap'). The kinematics of the sea lion's propulsive stroke are extracted from video data of unmarked, non-research sea lions at the Smithsonian Zoological Park (SNZ). Those data form the basis of the actuation motion of the robotic flipper presented here. The geometry of the robotic flipper is based a on high-resolution laser scan of a foreflipper of an adult female sea lion, scaled to about 60% of the full-scale flipper. The articulated model has three joints, mimicking the elbow, wrist and knuckle joint of the sea lion foreflipper. The robotic platform matches dynamics properties-Reynolds number and tip speed-of the animal when accelerating from rest. The robotic flipper can be used to determine the performance (forces and torques) and resulting flowfields.

"Using the Developmental Play Assessment, this preliminary study described the categories and levels of play with objects produced by 10 young boys with diagnoses of full mutation fragile X syndrome, the leading inherited cause of intellectual disability. Additionally, the study examined concurrent associations between child characteristics and three different summary level variables representing object play skills. Presentation Combinations (i.e., recreating structured configurations of objects) was the highest play level emerging or mastered for all participants. The number of toys touched during the play sample, an index of object interest, was positively related to standardized measures of receptive and expressive language while the number of different actions produced, an index of play diversity, was negatively related to autism symptom severity. Both variables were significantly related to the number of nonverbal communication acts children produced while interacting with their mothers in play. Clinical implications and future directions are discussed. Learning outcomes: Readers will be able to: (1) define a framework for categorizing developmental levels of play; (2) discuss the constructs represented by three different summary level metrics of play with objects; (3) describe the relationship between object-play skills and child characteristics for young males with FXS.

"Culverts are built at locations where a waterway crosses a road or railway and creates a limitation to flow passage. Furthermore, blockage commonly occurs during flood events with accumulation of debris at the culvert inlet. The inlet blockage changes the flow structure at the outlet and may result in culvert failure. Despite this, the impacts of blockage on culvert hydraulics and downstream waterways have not received consideration in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to mitigate this deficiency by reporting on an investigation into scouring at the outlet of partially blocked culverts. Experimental tests were conducted under steady flow to investigate a relationship between the maximum scour depth, blockage ratio of the culvert and the flow characteristics. Both non-blocked and partially blocked conditions were considered. Consideration of the results obtained showed that the scoured area and maximum scour depth increased with partially blocked culverts conditions compared with equivalent non-blocked culverts.

"This paper presents an adaptive building-skin system that attempts to establish the foundations for an intuitive and responsive interface between interior and exterior spaces with respect to environmental, thermal, acoustic, and user-comfort considerations. It does this by enabling each of its components to act as individual, context-aware, sensor-actuator nodes capable of differentiated-yet correlated-actions, reactions, and interactions. The proposal situates the system within an intelligent environment whose ecosystem's operational scope subsumes yet extends beyond interior environments to include exterior domains via wearable devices. Accordingly, as the sensed data of any device is accessible across all devices in a topology of meshed nodes, the computationally processed behavior of any node is potentially informed by and informing of the status of individual and/or sets of other nodes. In this manner, the building-skin is not construed as a mere envelope, but rather as a system comprised of agents that, in conjunction with all other embedded, ambulant, or wearable agents, actively promote the well-being, comfort, and spatial experience of users.

"This paper describes a series of reduced scale tests, at unit gravity, performed on circular footings supported by reinforced sand. Reinforcement by multiple layers of geocell was investigated and the performance of the footing was compared to one on the same sandy soil containing multi-layered planar geotextile reinforcement. The comparison used geocell and geotextile layers formed from the same parent geosynthetic material having the same characteristics but with a lower geocell mass. Results show that the efficiency of the reinforcement (described in terms of the load carrying and subgrade modulus enhancement) decreased as the number of layers increased. In tests at moderate and low footing settlements, significant improvements in bearing capacity and subgrade modulus were obtained with the application of three layers of geocell. On the whole, multi-layered geocell-reinforced soil provides a more effective and much stiffer system capable of delivering greater foundation loads and subgrade modulus than multi-layered planar reinforced soil, even when less parent geosynthetic material is used in the multi-layered geocell arrangement. Furthermore, reinforcement benefit is achievable at settlements as small as 0.2-0.4% of the footing diameter for the geocell installations, whereas settlements 4 to 5 times larger are needed before benefit is gained from a comparable planar geotextile system. To achieve comparable performances, the multi-layered geocell requires 1/4 to 1/2 the mass of geosynthetic material as that needed for multi-layered planar geotextile reinforcement (depending on the settlement allowable). The multi layered geocell reinforcement requires considerably less parent geosynthetic material (reducing transport and, perhaps supply costs), and because the size of reinforcement zone required is considerably smaller, the amount of excavation and backfill required is also significantly reduced.

"Screening alcohol use disorder (AUD) patients has been challenging due to the subjectivity involved in the process. Hence, robust and objective methods are needed to automate the screening of AUD patients. In this paper, a machine learning method is proposed that utilized resting-state electroencephalography (EEG)-derived features as input data to classify the AUD patients and healthy controls and to perform automatic screening of AUD patients. In this context, the EEG data were recorded during 5 min of eyes closed and 5 min of eyes open conditions. For this purpose, 30 AUD patients and 15 aged-matched healthy controls were recruited. After preprocessing the EEG data, EEG features such as inter-hemispheric coherences and spectral power for EEG delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma bands were computed involving 19 scalp locations. The selection of most discriminant features was performed with a rank-based feature selection method assigning a weight value to each feature according to a criterion, i.e., receiver operating characteristics curve. For example, a feature with large weight was considered more relevant to the target labels than a feature with less weight. Therefore, a reduced set of most discriminant features was identified and further be utilized during classification of AUD patients and healthy controls. As results, the inter-hemispheric coherences between the brain regions were found significantly different between the study groups and provided high classification efficiency (Accuracy = 80.8, sensitivity = 82.5, and specificity = 80, F-Measure = 0.78). In addition, the power computed in different EEG bands were found significant and provided an overall classification efficiency as (Accuracy = 86.6, sensitivity = 95, specificity = 82.5, and F-Measure = 0.88). Further, the integration of these EEG feature resulted into even higher results (Accuracy = 89.3 %, sensitivity = 88.5 %, specificity = 91 %, and F-Measure = 0.90). Based on the results, it is concluded that the EEG data (integration of the theta, beta, and gamma power and inter-hemispheric coherence) could be utilized as objective markers to screen the AUD patients and healthy controls.

"Human metabolism of the S-warfarin enantiomer is catalyzed primarily by cytochrome P4502C9 (CYP2C9), which, because of the enzyme's broad drug substrate specificity, leads to drug-S-warfarin interactions. Several warfarin analogs have been synthesized and used to determine whether they exhibit diminished interactions with CYP2C9. The kinetics of the warfarin analogs' inhibition of human liver microsomal CYP2C9 catalyzed metabolism of S-warfarin to S-7-hydroxywarfarin have been investigated. R- and S-7-fluorowarfarin were both predominantly competitive inhibitors, whereas racemic 6-fluorowarfarin and racemic 6,7,8-trifluorowarfarin were predominantly mixed inhibitors with some competitive inhibition. For the alcohols produced by reductive methylation of the side chain of R- and S-warfarin, the R-enantiomer did not inhibit S-warfarin metabolism, whereas the S-enantiomer was primarily a competitive inhibitor. The fluorine substituted warfarins and the S-warfarin alcohol apparently bind with high affinity to CYP2C9. Thus their use clinically (if efficacious) would not prevent CYP2C9 associated warfarin-drug interactions. The R-warfarin alcohol did not inhibit CYP2C9 catalyzed metabolism of S-warfarin and is less likely than warfarin to participate in CYP2C9 associated warfarin-drug interactions.

"Autonomous landing has become a core technology of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) guidance, navigation and control system in recent years. As a novel autonomous landing approach, computer vision has been studied and applied in rotary-wing UAV landing successfully. This paper aims to fixed-wing UAV and focus on two problems: how to find runway only depending on airborne front-looking camera and how to align UAV with the designated landing runway. The paper can be divided into two parts to solve above two problems respectively. In the first part, the paper firstly presents an algorithm of region of interest (ROI) detection, which is based on spectral residual saliency map, and then an algorithm of feature vector extraction based on sparse coding and spatial pyramid matching (SPM) is proposed, finally, ROI including designated landing runway is recognized by a linear support vector machine. In the second part, the paper presents an approach of relative position and pose estimation between UAV and landing runway. Estimation algorithm firstly selects five feature points on the runway surface, and then establishes a new earth-fixed reference frame, finally uses orthogonal iteration to estimate landing parameters including three parameters of distance, height and offset, and three pose parameters of roll, yaw, pitch. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the algorithms proposed in this paper.

"Altruistic behavior varies considerably across people and decision contexts. The relevant computational and motivational mechanisms that underlie its heterogeneity, however, are poorly understood. Using a charitable giving task together with multivariate decoding techniques, we identified three distinct psychological mechanisms underlying altruistic decision-making (empathy, perspective taking, and attentional reorienting) and linked them to dissociable neural computations. Neural responses in the anterior insula (AI) (but not temporoparietal junction [TPJ]) encoded trial-wise empathy for beneficiaries, whereas the TPJ (but not AI) predicted the degree of perspective taking. Importantly, the relative influence of both socio-cognitive processes differed across individuals: participants whose donation behavior was heavily influenced by affective empathy exhibited higher predictive accuracies for generosity in AI, whereas those who strongly relied on cognitive perspective taking showed improved predictions of generous donations in TPJ. Furthermore, subject-specific contributions of both processes for donations were reflected in participants' empathy and perspective taking responses in a separate fMRI task (EmpaToM), suggesting that process-specific inputs into altruistic choices may reflect participants' general propensity to either empathize or mentalize. Finally, using independent attention task data, we identified shared neural codes for attentional reorienting and generous donations in the posterior superior temporal sulcus, suggesting that domain-general attention shifts also contribute to generous behavior (but not in TPJ or AI). Overall, our findings demonstrate highly specific roles of AI for affective empathy and TPJ for cognitive perspective taking as precursors of prosocial behavior and suggest that these discrete routes of social cognition differentially drive intraindividual and interindividual differences in altruistic behavior.

"Coral reefs in the Xisha Islands (also known as the Paracel Islands in English), South China Sea, have experienced dramatic declines in coral cover. However, the current regional scale hard coral distribution of geomorphic and ecological zones, essential for reefs management in the context of global warming and ocean acidification, is not well documented. We analyzed data from field surveys, Landsat-8 and GF-1 images to map the distribution of hard coral within geomorphic zones and reef flat ecological zones. In situ surveys conducted in June 2014 on nine reefs provided a complete picture of reef status with regard to live coral diversity, evenness of coral cover and reef health (live versus dead cover) for the Xisha Islands. Mean coral cover was 12.5% in 2014 and damaged reefs seemed to show signs of recovery. Coral cover in sheltered habitats such as lagoon patch reefs and biotic dense zones of reef flats was higher, but there were large regional differences and low diversity. In contrast, the more exposed reef slopes had high coral diversity, along with high and more equal distributions of coral cover. Mean hard coral cover of other zones was < 10%. The total Xisha reef system was estimated to cover 1 060 km(2), and the emergent reefs covered similar to 787 m(2). Hard corals of emergent reefs were considered to cover 97 km(2). The biotic dense zone of the reef flat was a very common zone on all simple atolls, especially the broader northern reef flats. The total cover of live and dead coral can reach above 70% in this zone, showing an equilibrium between live and dead coral as opposed to coral and algae. This information regarding the spatial distribution of hard coral can support and inform the management of Xisha reef ecosystems.

"Environmental epigenetics is the study of how environmental signals affect gene expression. Within this growing field of molecular biology, experiments on the epigenetic effects of 'maternal care' on offspring health have received much scientific and public attention and are often called upon to showcase how environmental epigenetics will create a new understanding of life as inherently 'biosocial.' While, on the one hand, this research is exciting and offers possible opportunities for collaboration between molecular biology and the social sciences, it is also necessary to consider its political dimensions. In this paper, we show how commonsense assumptions about sex, gender, sexuality, and class are present in the design, interpretation, and dissemination of experiments on the epigenetic effects of maternal care. As these experiments come to support claims about human motherhood through a dense speculative cross-traffic between epigenetic studies in rodents and psychological and epidemiological studies in humans, current research trends work to illustrate rather than interrogate existing stereotypes about maternal agency and responsibility. With this analysis, we offer a cautionary perspective regarding the potentials and challenges for new forms of collaborative biosocial knowledge practices emerging out of environmental epigenetics.

"Despite extensive literature on parental monitoring, few studies have focused on father-youth solicitation in particular and none on solicitation via communication technology. To address this gap, this study explored the relationships between fathers' online and in-person solicitation of their adolescent and emerging adult children, and the youth's internalizing, externalizing, and prosocial behaviors. A sample of US fathers (N = 158) reported on solicitation patterns, use of technology, and their child's behaviors. The results revealed differences by demographics, and an inverse trend between online and in-person solicitation in relation to internalizing, externalizing, and prosocial behaviors. Regression analyses revealed that online solicitation of information from the youth's friends was related to greater internalizing and externalizing, and less prosocial behavior. These findings support research suggesting that some forms of online solicitation may be interpreted by adolescents and emerging adults as intrusive and a violation of privacy.

"Rainwater harvesting (RWH) may be an effective alternative water supply solution in regions affected by water scarcity. It has recently become a particularly important option in arid and semi-arid areas (like Mediterranean basins), mostly because of its many benefits and affordable costs. This study provides an analysis of the reliability of using a rainwater harvesting system to supply water for toilet flushing and garden irrigation purposes, with reference to a single-family home in a residential area of Sicily (Southern Italy). A flushing water demand pattern was evaluated using water consumption data collected from a sample of residential customers during an extended measurement campaign. A daily water balance simulation of the rainwater storage tank was performed, and the yield-after-spillage algorithm was used to define the tank release rule. The model's performance was evaluated using rainfall data from more than 100 different sites located throughout the Sicilian territory. This regional analysis provided annual reliability curves for the system as a function of mean annual precipitation, which have practical applications in this area of study. The uncertainty related to the regional model predictions was also assessed. A cost-benefit analysis highlighted that the implementation of a rainwater harvesting system in Sicily can provide environmental and economic advantages over traditional water supply methods. In particular, the regional analysis identified areas where the application of this system would be most effective.

"Systems cell biology understanding of development requires characterization of all the molecules produced in the biological system. Decades of research and new-generation sequencing provided functional information on key genes and transcripts. However, there is less information available on how differential gene expression translates into the domains of functionally important proteins, peptides, and metabolites, and how changes in these molecules impact development. Mass spectrometry (MS) is the current technology of choice for the detection and quantification of large numbers of proteins and metabolites, because it requires no use of antibodies, functional probes, or a priori knowledge of molecules produced in the system. This review focuses on recent technologies that have improved MS sensitivity for proteins and metabolites and enabled new functionalities to assess their temporal and spatial changes during vertebrate embryonic development. This review highlights case studies, in which new-generation MS tools have enabled the study of hundreds-to-thousands of proteins and metabolites in tissues, cell populations, and single cells in model systems of vertebrate development, particularly the frog (Xenopus), zebrafish, and mouse. New-generation MS expands the toolbox of cell and developmental studies, raising exciting potentials to advance basic and translational research in the life sciences.

"This paper presents the results of triaxial tests conducted for the investigation of the influence of geotextiles on stress-strain and volumetric change behaviour of reinforced sandy soil. Tests were carried out on loose sandy soil. The experimental program includes drained compression tests on samples reinforced with different values of both geotextiles layers (Ng) and confining pressure (sigma'(c)). Two methods of preparation were used: air pluviation (AP) and moist tamping (MT). Test results show that the geotextiles induce a quasi-linear increase in the stress deviator (q) and volume contraction in the reinforced sand. Method of preparation significantly affects the shear strength; samples prepared by the air pluviation method and mobilized deviator stresses are significantly higher than those prepared by moist tamping method. Geotextiles restrict the dilation of reinforced sandy soil and consequently the contraction increases. The mobilized friction angle increases with increasing number of layers and decreases with increasing initial confining pressure. Samples prepared by moist tamping present mobilized friction angles significantly lower than those prepared by air pluviation method. For samples prepared by the air pluviation method, the secant modulus at epsilon(1)=1% and 5% decreases with increasing geotextile layers; those prepared by the moist tamping method, secant modulus at epsilon(1)=1% and 5% increases with increasing number of geotextile layer sand confining pressure. From 10% axial strain, secant modulus increases with increasing inclusions of geotextile layers.

"With the help of new design tools, manufacturing-integrated solutions can be generated that concurrently consider function and process. Based on the design pattern matrix, solution elements can be developed that realize the product function by systematically utilizing manufacturing-induced properties. The developed manufacturing-integrated product solutions are refined using computer-aided methods (feature-based modeling and information modeling). A product embodiment is generated that is specifically tailored to the chosen manufacturing technology. An integrated information model allows the introduced tools to be used throughout the entire development process. The example of a linear flow split snap-fit fastening illustrates how the tools beneficially interact and realize manufacturing potential, resulting in an innovative product design.

"Accurately scaling sap flux observations to tree or stand levels requires accounting for variation in sap flux between wood types and by depth into the tree. However, existing models for radial variation in axial sap flux are rarely used because they are difficult to implement. there is uncertainty about their predictive ability and calibration measurements are often unavailable. Here we compare different models with a diverse sap flux data set to test the hypotheses that radial profiles differ by wood type and tree size. We show that radial variation in sap flux is dependent on wood type but independent of tree size for a range of temperate trees. The best-fitting model predicted out-of-sample sap flux observations and independent estimates of sapwood area with small errors, suggesting robustness in the new settings. We develop a method for predicting whole-tree water use with this model and include computer code for simple implementation in other studies.

"Background: Few authors have investigated patients' expectations from foot and ankle surgery. In this study, we aimed to examine relationships between patients' preoperative expectations and their demographic and clinical characteristics. We hypothesized that patients with more disability and those with anxiety or depressive symptoms would have greater expectations. Methods: All adult patients scheduled for elective foot or ankle surgery by 1 of 6 orthopaedic foot and ankle surgeons were screened for inclusion over 8 months. Preoperatively, all patients completed the Hospital for Special Surgery Foot & Ankle Surgery Expectations Survey in addition to the Foot & Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS), Short Form (SF)-12, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-8, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7), and pain visual analog scale (VAS). The expectations survey contained 23 expectations categories, each with 5 answer choices ranging from I do not have this expectation to complete improvement expected. It was scored from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more expectations. Differences in expectations relating to numerous patient demographic and clinical variables were assessed. In total, 352 patients with an average age of 55 15 (range, 18-86) years were enrolled. Results: Expectations scores were not related to age (P = .36). On average, women expected to achieve complete improvement more often than men (P = .011). Variables that were significantly associated with higher expectations scores (P < .05) included nonwhite race, use of a cane or other assistive device, and greater medical comorbidity. Worse function and quality of life (as assessed by all FAOS subscales and the SF-12 physical and mental components), more depressive and anxiety symptoms, and higher pain VAS scores were associated with higher expectations scores and more expectations (P < .01 for all). Conclusions: The results of this study may help inform surgeons' preoperative discussions with their patients regarding realistic expectations from surgery. Generally, patients with worse function and more disability had higher expectations from surgery. Addressing these patients' expectations preoperatively may help improve their ultimate satisfaction with surgery. Level of Evidence: Level II, cross sectional study.

"Whether superiors or subordinates are more accurate in assessing the emotions of others (aka emotion recognition accuracy, ERA) is a question that has gained much interest but yielded decidedly mixed empirical results. The present study investigates whether superiors and subordinates who are in an actual hierarchical relationship differ in their ERA. We investigated 142 superiors who each had recruited one of his or her direct subordinates (total N = 284). Superiors and subordinates each took a paper-pencil version of a standardized ERA test. Results showed that superiors were more accurate in assessing the emotions of other persons than subordinates were.

"Recent in silico studies suggested that the transcription cofactor LIM-only protein FHL2 is a major transcriptional regulator of mouse natural killer (NK) cells. However, the expression and role of FHL2 in NK cell biology are unknown. Here, we confirm that FHL2 is expressed in both mouse and human NK cells. Using FHL2(-/-) mice, we found that FHL2 controls NK cell development in the bone marrow and maturation in peripheral organs. To evaluate the importance of FHL2 in NK cell activation, FHL2(-/-) mice were infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae. FHL2(-/-) mice are highly susceptible to this infection. The activation of lung NK cells is altered in FHL2(-/-) mice, leading to decreased IFN. production and a loss of control of bacterial burden. Collectively, our data reveal that FHL2 is a new transcription cofactor implicated in NK cell development and activation during pulmonary bacterial infection.

"Transition of the precision engineering and instrumentation to the widespread use of nanoscale structures and thin layers requires improved localization methods for measuring the depth of the material. Unified standards and the generally accepted methods for measuring the wear resistance and friction coefficient are not currently available. The aim of this work was the development of a universal friction machine with the simplified requirements for the preparation and the geometric shape of the sample and the opposing disc. An important requirement for the equipment and the method of measurement is the ability to measure the friction coefficient and the determination of the wear resistance of coatings and hardened layers of micron and submicron thicknesses. Another important requirement is modeling in the experiment of acyclic friction process, as close as possible to the real operating conditions of components and parts. Both of these conditions are successfully realized by using the method of disc on plate. Implementation of disk on plate method was used to simplify and improve the rapid measurement, and to minimize load on the friction assembly, reduce friction pair temperature, increase the sensitivity and improve the resistive bridge thermal stabilization. The complex for the study of friction and wear processes of various materials pairs in conditions close to operational was manufactured and tested. The measuring console with a low value of the parasitic load on the measuring cell was designed. A computerized hardware and software system for the registration of the friction parameters of the process was developed. The software for processing and storage of experiment results was developed. The software is compatible with modern Windows operating systems. The file format for measurement results storage is compatible with the conventional graphic editors and could be processed by means of Excel. The main principles of the analysis and processing of the results are consequentially described. Typical results of usage of the developed machine for friction coefficient measurements and the determination of the wear resistance of massive, homogeneous surface-hardened materials and alloys with coatings are shown. The high efficiency of the created equipment complex during investigation of coatings, optimization of coating depositing processes and the modification of the surface layers are shown in the study. The efficiency of the complex was confirmed by the study of the modified layers and micron thickness coatings. It was found that the friction coefficient and wear resistance of construction materials, modified thin microcrystalline layers and nanostructured coatings was effectively controlled by using of the created complex.

"Text detection in a natural environment plays an important role in many computer vision applications. While existing text detection methods are focused on English characters, there are strong application demands on text detection in other languages, such as Chinese. In this paper, we present a novel text detection algorithm for Chinese characters based on a specific designed convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN contains a text structure component detector layer, a spatial pyramid layer, and a multi-input-layer deep belief network (DBN). The CNN is pre-trained via a convolutional sparse auto-encoder, specifically designed for extracting complex features from Chinese characters. In particular, the text structure component detectors enhance the accuracy and uniqueness of feature descriptors by extracting multiple text structure components in various ways. The spatial pyramid layer enhances the scale invariability of the CNN for detecting texts in multiple scales. Finally, the multi-input-layer DBN replaces the fully connected layers in the CNN to ensure features from multiple scales are comparable. A multilingual text detection dataset, in which texts in Chinese, English, and digits are labeled separately, is set up to evaluate the proposed text detection algorithm. The proposed algorithm shows a significant performance improvement over the baseline CNN algorithms. In addition the proposed algorithm is evaluated over a public multilingual benchmark and achieves state-of-the-art result under multiple languages. Furthermore, a simplified version of the proposed algorithm with only general components is evaluated on the ICDAR 2011 and 2013 datasets, showing comparable detection performance to the existing general text detection algorithms.

"With the rapid technological development of various satellite sensors, high-resolution remotely sensed imagery has been an important source of data for change detection in land cover transition. However, it is still a challenging problem to effectively exploit the available spectral information to highlight changes. In this paper, we present a novel change detection framework for high-resolution remote sensing images, which incorporates superpixel-based change feature extraction and hierarchical difference representation learning by neural networks. First, highly homogenous and compact image superpixels are generated using superpixel segmentation, which makes these image blocks adhere well to image boundaries. Second, the change features are extracted to represent the difference information using spectrum, texture, and spatial features between the corresponding superpixels. Third, motivated by the fact that deep neural network has the ability to learn from data sets that have few labeled data, we use it to learn the semantic difference between the changed and unchanged pixels. The labeled data can be selected from the bitemporal multispectral images via a preclassification map generated in advance. And then, a neural network is built to learn the difference and classify the uncertain samples into changed or unchanged ones. Finally, a robust and high-contrast change detection result can be obtained from the network. The experimental results on the real data sets demonstrate its effectiveness, feasibility, and superiority of the proposed technique.

"Inferences about moral character may often drive outrage over symbolic acts of racial bigotry. Study 1 demonstrates a theoretically predicted dissociation between moral evaluations of an act and the person who carries out the act. Although Americans regarded the private use of a racial slur as a less blameworthy act than physical assault, use of a slur was perceived as a clearer indicator of poor moral character. Study 2 highlights the dynamic interplay between moral judgments of acts and persons, demonstrating that first making person judgments can bias subsequent act judgments. Privately defacing a picture of Martin Luther King, Jr. led to greater moral condemnation of the agent than of the act itself only when the behavior was evaluated first. When Americans first made character judgments, symbolically defacing a picture of the civil rights leader was significantly more likely to be perceived as an immoral act. These studies support a person-centered account of outrage over bigotry and demonstrate that moral evaluations of acts and persons converge and diverge under theoretically meaningful circumstances.

"In this paper I criticize theory-biased and overly individualist approaches to understanding others and introduce the PAIR account of joint attention as a pragmatic, affectively charged intentional relation. I argue that this relation obtains in virtue of intentional contents in the minds of the co-attenders, and - against the received understanding of intentional states as propositional attitudes - that we should recognize what I call 'subject mode' and 'position mode' intentional content. Based on findings from developmental psychology, I propose that this subject mode content represents the co-attenders as co-subjects, who are like them and who are at least disposed to act jointly with them. I conclude by arguing that in joint attention we experience and understand affective, actional and perceptual relations at a non-conceptual level prior to the differentiation of mind and body.

"We propose stronger halo effects in trait assessments from positive information relative to negative information. Due to positive information's higher similarity, positive information should foster both indirect (from a global impression to traits) and direct halo effects (from traits to traits). Negative information's relative distinctiveness should foster only direct halo effects, leading to weaker halo effects overall. Four experiments support these predictions using agency traits and communion traits and behaviors. Further supporting the predictions, halo effects from positive information were visible both within (i.e., from communion/agency information to communion/agency traits) and across (i.e., from agency/communion information to communion/agency traits) these fundamental dimensions of social perception. Halo effects from negative information were visible only within dimensions. The study thereby explains why halo effects from negative information are usually weaker; it supports different processes underlying halo effects; and it provides a case in person perception where positive information has more impact than negative information.

"Traditional network architecture is inflexible and complex. This observation has led to a paradigm shift toward software-defined networks (SDNs), in which the network control level is separated from the data link layer. This change became possible because of the control plane transfer from switching equipment to software modules that run on a dedicated server called a controller (or a network operating system) or to network applications that work with this controller. Methods of presentation, storage, and communication interfaces with network topology elements available to SDN controller users are the most important aspects of network operating systems because the operation of some key controller modules depends heavily on the internal representation of the network topology. Firewall and routing modules can be cited as examples of these modules. This paper considers the methods used to represent and store the network topology, as well as communication interfaces with corresponding modules of the Floodlight controller. An alternative algorithm for exchanging messages on the changes in the network topology between the controller and network applications has been proposed and developed. The algorithm makes it possible to issue notifications based on a subscription to relevant events. An API for the module of interacting with applied programs of the SDN controller has been developed. The Topology Tracker module has been designed based on this algorithm and API. In active mode, this module can inform network applications about the changes in the network topology and store its compact representation for the interaction acceleration.

"Secondary osteoporosis is a frequent complication of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and the result of an imbalance of catabolic and anabolic mechanisms of bone metabolism. The effects of serial low-dose radon and hyperthermia (LDRnHT) exposure in a therapeutic adit (12 applications in 3 weeks) on the serum levels of the cytokines osteoprotegerin (OPG), receptor activator of NF kappa-B ligand (RANKL), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and also on the RANKL/OPG ratio were investigated in 25 RA patients and an age-matched control of 24 patients with osteoarthritis (OA). Cytokine measurements were performed at baseline and after completion of LDRnHT. Anti-CCP antibodies (ACPA) were measured in RA patients in parallel. Medication in both groups was limited to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and low-dose prednisolone (16 of 24 RA patients) as needed. RA and OA patients showed a significant decrease of TNF-alpha levels (p < 0.001). Both groups showed significantly decreased levels of RANKL (RA: p < 0.001, OA: p < 0.01). Only the RA patients presented a significant increase of OPG (p < 0.01) and decrease of the RANKL/OPG ratio (p < 0.01), and the ACPA levels (p < 0.001). LDRnHT results in a reduction of osteocatabolic and an increase of osteoanabolic cytokines, which represents the molecular basis for inhibiting osteoclastic activity in secondary osteoporosis and explains in part the effect of LDRnHT this physical therapy modality in a key inflammatory disease. Although reduced ACPA levels were observed under the therapy and although this could potentially contribute to an osteoprotective effect, in this case, it is rather uncertain as the reduction was only minor in magnitude.

After exposure to either a category or a homophobic label, heterosexual participants allocated fictitious resources to two different prevention programmes: one mainly relevant to heterosexuals (sterility prevention), the other to homosexuals (AIDS-HIV prevention). Responses on allocation matrices served to identify strategies that favoured the ingroup over the outgroup. Results indicated stronger ingroup-favouritism in the homophobic than in the category label condition. This study shows that discriminatory group labels have tangible effects on people's monetary behaviours in intergroup contexts, increasing their tendency to favour the ingroup when distributing resources.

EEG recordings showed a suppression-burst (SB) pattern and multifocal paroxysmal activity in both. In addition both had quadriplegia, acquired microcephaly, and severe intellectual disability. General examination showed distal arthrogryposis predominant in the hands in both siblings and severe left dorso-lumbar convex scoliosis in one. WGSof the siblings-parents quartet identified novel compound heterozygous mutations in SLC35A3 in both children. SLC35A3 encodes the major Golgi uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine transporter. With this study, we add SLC35A3 to the gene list of epilepsies. Neurological symptoms and skeletal abnormalities might result from impaired glycosylation of proteins involved in normal development and function of the central nervous system and skeletal apparatus.

"In this work, we carried out a theoretical analysis of the reflection, transmission and surface deformation of long linear water waves, propagating on a submerged breakwater whose cross-section obeys a cycloidal geometric transition. We use the well-known one-dimensional governing equations for the propagation of linear shallow-water waves, which are presented in their dimensionless version. Considering harmonic wave propagation, the governing equations can be reduced to a dimensionless second-order differential equation with variable coefficients for predicting the elevation of water waves. This equation is solved using a matrix method based on Taylor polynomials. In particular, we evaluate the reflection and transmission coefficients for three breakwaters, namely, cycloidal, semi-cycloidal and quarter-cycloidal. The first case exhibits the smallest transmission coefficient. The present mathematical model is compared with a simple numerical solution and with another analytical solution expressed in terms of the Legendre functions. The present mathematical model can be used as a practical reference for design of the geometrical configurations of submerged cycloidal breakwaters under shallow-flow conditions.

"This paper presents results of a series of undrained monotonic compression tests on loose sand reinforced with geotextile mainly to study the effect of confining stress on the mechanical behaviour of geotextile reinforced sand. The triaxial tests were performed on reconstituted specimens of dry natural sand prepared at loose relative density (Dr = 30%) with and without geotextile layers and consolidated to three levels of confining pressures 50, 100 and 200 kPa, where different numbers and different arrangements of reinforcement layers were placed at different heights of the specimens (0, 1 and 2 layers). The behaviour of test specimens was presented and discussed. Test results showed that geotextile inclusion improves the mechanical behaviour of sand, a significant increase in the shear strength and cohesion value is obtained by adding up layers of reinforcement. Also, the results indicate that the strength ratio is more pronounced for samples which were subjected to low value of confining pressure. The obtained results reveal that high value of confining pressure can restrict the sand shear dilatancy and the more effect of reinforcement efficiently.

"Social identity theory suggests that people use social categories such as race and gender as the basis of interpersonal judgments and demonstrate biases favoring their ingroups, and that this discrimination against out-groups includes hiring and other personnel decisions. This research examines whether, in the context of other information, participants will use a person's religion and show typical intergroup biases often seen between racial groups. One hundred and seventy-five Black Christian participants viewed fictional job applicants of different religions (Christian/Muslim/atheist) and races (Black/White). Thirty-two percent of participants explicitly reported using the applicant's religion (but seldom reported using their race) as a source of evaluation and showed a consistent preference for Christian (ingroup) over Muslim and atheist (outgroup) applicants. In contrast, those who did not acknowledge using religion showed some racial ingroup bias but none for religion. This research has implications for workplace discrimination, hiring practices, and racial and religious group relations. (C) 2016 Western Social Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

"Since the mid 1970s, when membrane modules became available, plasma separation techniques have gained in importance especially in the past few years. The advantages of this method are a complete separation of the corpuscular components from the plasma and due to increased blood flow rate and higher efficacy. Systemic autoimmune diseases based on an immune pathogenesis produce autoantibodies and circulating immune complexes, which cause inflammation in the tissues of various organs. In most cases, these diseases have a poor prognosis without treatment. Therapeutic apheresis (TA) in combination with immunosuppressive therapies has led to a steady increase in survival rates over the last 40years. The updated information on immunology and molecular biology of different immunologic diseases are discussed in relation to the rationale for apheresis therapy and its place in combination with other modern treatments. The different diseases can be treated by various apheresis methods such as therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) with substitution solution, or with online plasma or blood purification using adsorption columns, which contain biological or non-biological agents. Here, the authors provide an overview of the most important pathogenic aspects indicating that TA can be a supportive therapy in systemic autoimmune diseases such as renal and neurological disorders. For the immunological diseases that can be treated with TA, the guidelines of the German Working Group of Clinical Nephrology and of the Apheresis Committee of the American Society for Apheresis are cited.

"Background In the central nervous system (CNS), G proteincoupled receptors (GPCRs) are the most fruitful targets for neuropsychopharmacological drug development. Rhodopsin (class A) is the most studied class of GPCR and includes orphan receptors for which the endogenous ligand is not known or is unclear. Characterization of orphan GPCRs has proven to be challenging, and the production pace of GPCR-based drugs has been incredibly slow. Objective Determination of the functions of these receptors may provide unexpected insight into physiological and neuropathological processes. Advances in various methods and techniques to investigate orphan receptors including in situ hybridization and knockdown/knockout (KD/KO) showed extensive expression of these receptors in the mammalian brain and unmasked their physiological and neuropathological roles. Due to these rapid progress and development, orphan GPCRs are rising as a new and promising class of drug targets for neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric disorders. Conclusion This review presents a neuropsychopharmacological perspective of 26 orphan receptors of rhodopsin (class A) family, namely GPR3, GPR6, GPR12, GPR17, GPR26, GPR35, GPR39, GPR48, GPR49, GPR50, GPR52, GPR55, GPR61, GPR62, GPR63, GPR68, GPR75, GPR78, GPR83, GPR84, GPR85, GPR88, GPR153, GPR162, GPR171, and TAAR6. We discussed the expression of these receptors in mammalian brain and their physiological roles. Furthermore, we have briefly highlighted their roles in neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, neuroinflammation, inflammatory pain, bipolar and schizophrenic disorders, epilepsy, anxiety, and depression.

"the past, the Entity-Component-System (ECS) pattern has become a major design pattern used in modern architectures for Realtime Interactive Systems (RIS). In this paper we introduce high performance wait-free hash maps for the System access of Components within the ECS pattern. This allows non-locking read and write operations, leading to a highly responsive low-latency data access while maintaining a consistent data state. Furthermore, we present centralized as well as decentralized approaches for reducing the memory demand of these memory-intensive wait-free hash maps for diverse RIS applications. Our approaches gain their efficiency by Component-wise queues which use atomic markup operations for fast memory deletion. We have implemented our new method in a current RIS and the results show that our approach is able to efficiently reduce the memory usage of wait-free hash maps very effectively by more than a factor of ten while still maintaining their high performance. Furthermore, we derive best practices from our numerical results for different use cases of wait-free hash map memory management in diverse RIS applications.

"The current increase in the deployment of new renewable electricity generation systems is creating new challenges in balancing electric grids. Solutions including energy storage at small and large scales are becoming of paramount importance to guarantee and secure a stable supply of electricity. This paper presents a study about a hybrid solution including a large scale energy storage system coupled with power generation and fast responding energy storage systems. The hybrid plant is able to deliver the energy previously stored by using an air liquefaction process either with or without the contribution of additional energy from combustion. The paper also highlights how such hybrid plants may offer the chance of providing the grid with fast control services. An ideal energy storage technology should have a high power rating, a large storage capacity, high efficiency, low costs and no geographic constraints. The use of air as energy carrier has been studied since the 20th century with the first compressed air energy storage (CAES) systems. This technology is still considered to have a potential but it is geographically constrained, where suitable geological reservoirs are available, unless compressed air is stored in pressurized tanks with significant costs. Liquid Air Energy Storage (LAES) represents an interesting solution due to its relatively large volumetric energy density and ease of storage. Different process schemes for hybrid plants were modeled in this study with Aspen HYSYS (R) simulation software and the results were compared in terms of equivalent round-trip and fuel efficiencies. Equivalent round-trip efficiencies, higher than 80%, have been calculated showing that the proposed configurations might play an important role for power systems balancing in the near future.

"The macrophyte biological index for rivers (IBMR) is the only method which describes eutrophication as well as organic pollution in a single index value. Presence of Hippuris vulgaris in water or lack thereof may affect the IBMR value. Potential effects of water pollution with Decis 2.5 EC containing deltamethrin in a water/sediment/plant system were the objectives of this research because this insecticide often occurs in soil and water as a contamination. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to answer the question of how Decis 2.5 EC as stress factor affects the growth of H. vulgaris, and determine the persistence of deltamethrin in the water/sediment/plant system. This study was conducted under different trophic levels during 18 wk in each of 3 consecutive years. The half-life of deltamethrin in water was estimated in the test system. It was found that H. vulgaris demonstrated its ability to survive in the water/sediment environment contaminated with Decis 2.5 EC despite the inhibition of the plant's development. In the presence of insecticidal formulation, the plant's growth was much slower compared to control. The tolerance index ranged from 0.19 to 0.37 with the lower values obtained for the higher concentration of phosphorus, nitrogen, potassium. Long-term studies of H. vulgaris grown under different trophic conditions indicate that despite the plant's ability to survive the contamination with Decis 2.5 EC, the timing of the macrophytes assessment is crucial to assess the occurrence and development of this plant and the ecological status of water.

"This paper concerns the net effects of promoting renewable energies on value added and disposable income in Germany, as well as their distribution among regions and income brackets. Since its entry into force, the German Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) has stimulated tremendous investments in renewable energy capacities by guaranteeing investors a fixed price per kWh as well as a preferred feed into the grid over electricity from conventional sources. The policy measures are financed by a surcharge on electricity prices. In recent years, a controversy has arisen about potentially negative regional and social distribution effects. In this paper, multiregional price and quantity input-output models with endogenous heterogeneous households are used to trace the indirect impacts of the EEG on value added and disposable income through the complex network of regional value chains. Our findings suggest that the generation of electricity from renewable sources itself leads to small positive impacts on industries, but leads to a significant drain on household income and'has regressive distributive effects. However, investment in new capacities may possibly transform these negative impacts into a positive direction for the majority of households. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"Background and aims: To determine the relationship between the risk of exercise addiction (REA) and health status in amateur endurance cyclists. Methods: In 859 (751 men and 108 women) cyclists and 718 inactive subjects (307 men and 411 women), we examined the REA (Exercise Addiction Inventory), training status (volume, frequency, experience, and performance), socioeconomic status, quality of life (QoL) (SF-12), quality of sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and cardiometabolic risk: body mass index, physical activity (International Physical Activity Questionnaire), physical condition (International Fitness Scale), adherence to the Mediterranean diet (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener), alcohol and tobacco consumption. Results: In total, 17% of the cyclists showed evidence of REA and 83% showed low REA. REA occurred independent of age, sex, training, and socioeconomic status (all ps >.05). Regardless of REA, the cyclists displayed a better physical QoL and a lower cardiometabolic risk than the inactive subjects (all ps < .05). The cyclists with REA displayed worse values of mental QoL, quality of sleep, and anxiety than cyclists with low REA (all ps < .05). The REA group had better values of mental QoL and anxiety and similar values of quality of sleep than the inactive subjects. The differences in mental QoL between the REA and low REA groups were significantly greater in women (p = .013). There was no Addiction x Sex interaction in the other analyzed variables. Conclusion: Our results suggest that an increased prevalence of REA limits the benefits that amateur endurance cycling has on mental health and quality of sleep.

"Smart environments (SmE) are richly integrated with multiple heterogeneous devices; they perform the operations in intelligent manner by considering the context and actions/behaviors of the users. Their major objective is to enable the environment to provide ease and comfort to the users. The reliance on these systems demands consistent behavior. The versatility of devices, user behavior and intricacy of communication complicate the modeling and verification of SmE's reliable behavior. Of the many available modeling and verification techniques, formal methods appear to be the most promising. Due to a large variety of implementation scenarios and support for conditional behavior/processing, the concept of SmE is applicable to diverse areas which calls for focused research. As a result, a number of modeling and verification techniques have been made available for designers. This paper explores and puts into perspective the modeling and verification techniques based on an extended literature survey. These techniques mainly focus on some specific aspects, with a few overlapping scenarios (such as user interaction, devices interaction and control, context awareness, etc.), which were of the interest to the researchers based on their specialized competencies. The techniques are categorized on the basis of various factors and formalisms considered for the modeling and verification and later analyzed. The results show that no surveyed technique maintains a holistic perspective; each technique is used for the modeling and verification of specific SmE aspects. The results further help the designers select appropriate modeling and verification techniques under given requirements and stress for more R&D effort into SmE modeling and verification research.

"Recent years have witnessed the increasing emphasis on human aspects in software engineering research and practices. Our survey of existing studies on human aspects in software engineering shows that screen-captured videos have been widely used to record developers' behavior and study software engineering practices. The screen-captured videos provide direct information about which software tools the developers interact with and which content they access or generate during the task. Such Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) data can help researchers and practitioners understand and improve software engineering practices from human perspective. However, extracting time-series HCI data from screen-captured task videos requires manual transcribing and coding of videos, which is tedious and error-prone. In this paper we report a formative study to understand the challenges in manually transcribing screen-captured videos into time-series HCI data. We then present a computer-vision based video scraping technique to automatically extract time-series HCI data from screen-captured videos. We also present a case study of our scvRipper tool that implements the video scraping technique using 29-hours of task videos of 20 developers in two development tasks. The case study not only evaluates the runtime performance and robustness of the tool, but also performs a detailed quantitative analysis of the tool's ability to extract time-series HCI data from screen-captured task videos. We also study the developer's micro-level behavior patterns in software development from the quantitative analysis.

"Young individuals better memorize initially seen faces with emotional rather than neutral expressions. Healthy older participants and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients show better memory for faces with positive expressions. The socioemotional selectivity theory postulates that this positivity effect in memory reflects a general age-related preference for positive stimuli, subserving emotion regulation. Another explanation might be that older participants use compensatory strategies, often considering happy faces as previously seen. The question about the existence of this effect in tasks not permitting such compensatory strategies is still open. Thus, we compared the performance of healthy participants and AD patients for positive, neutral, and negative faces in such tasks. Healthy older participants and AD patients showed a positivity effect in memory, but there was no difference between emotional and neutral faces in young participants. Our results suggest that the positivity effect in memory is not entirely due to the sense of familiarity for smiling faces.

"Purpose The application of organic and inorganic fertilizers to soil can result in increased gaseous emissions, such as NH3, N2O, CO2, and CH4, as well as nitrate leaching, contributing to climate warming and ground and surface water pollution, particularly in regions with hot climates, where high temperatures and high soil nitrification rates often occur. The use of nitrification inhibitors (NIs) has been shown to effectively decrease nitrogen (N) losses from the soil-plant system. Materials and methods Non-disruptive laboratory incubation experiments were conducted to assess the extent to which temperature (20 and 30 degrees C) and nutrient source (mineral and organic fertilizers) influence the rate of carbon (C)- and N-related microbial processes in soil in response to the NI 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP). Furthermore, short-term changes in the ability of microbes to degrade C substrates were evaluated in disruptive soil microcosms using microbial community-level physiological profiling and the abundance of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene as a measure of total bacterial population size. Results and discussion DMPP reduced net nitrification after 2 and 4 weeks of incubation at 30 and 20 degrees C by an average of 78.3 and 84.5 %, respectively, and with similar dynamics for mineral or organic fertilization. The addition of labile organic matter with cattle effluent led to a rapid increase in C mineralization that was significantly reduced by DMPP at both temperatures, whereas no changes could be detected after the addition of mineral fertilizer. The culturable heterotrophic microorganisms showed metabolic diversification in the oxidation of C sources, with organic fertilizer playing a major role in the substrate utilization patterns during the first week of incubation and the DMPP effects prevailing from day 14 until day 28. Furthermore, the copy number of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was reduced by the application of DMPP and organic fertilizer after 28 days. Conclusions Our results show the marked efficiency of DMPP as an NI at elevated temperatures of incubation and when associated with both mineral and organic fertilization, providing support for its use as a tool to mitigate N losses in Mediterranean ecosystems. However, we also observed impaired C respiration rates and bacterial abundances, as well as shifts in communitylevel physiological profiles in soil, possibly indicating a short-term effect of DMPP and organic fertilizers on non-target Crelated processes and microorganisms.

We present three cases of severe arterial tortuosity with different manifestations. In two cases, the aortic arch was involved. Angiography showed a very tortuous aortic arch, with many loops and twists and a normal descending aorta. One required operation. The third case presented multiple severe stenoses of both pulmonary arteries with many tortuous segments. Surgical repair consisted of pulmonary artery augmentation utilizing a bovine pericardial patch from hilum to hilum.

"OBJECTIVE. The purposes of this article are to describe concepts that radiologists should understand to evaluate machine learning projects, including common algorithms, supervised as opposed to unsupervised techniques, statistical pitfalls, and data considerations for training and evaluation, and to briefly describe ethical dilemmas and legal risk. CONCLUSION. Machine learning includes a broad class of computer programs that improve with experience. The complexity of creating, training, and monitoring machine learning indicates that the success of the algorithms will require radiologist involvement for years to come, leading to engagement rather than replacement.

"Psychological research on the relationship between spirituality/religion and mental health has grown considerably over the past several decades and now constitutes a sizable body of scholarship. Among dimensions of S/R, positive beliefs about God have been significantly related to better mental health outcomes, and conversely negative beliefs about God are generally associated with more distress. However, prior research on this topic has relied heavily upon self-report Likert-type scales, which are vulnerable to self-report biases and measure only explicit cognitive processes. In this study, we developed and validated an implicit social cognition task, the Positive/Negative God Go/No-go Association Task (PNG-GNAT), for use in psychological research on spirituality and religion (S/R). Preliminary evidence in a large sample (N = 381) suggests that the PNG-GNAT demonstrates internal consistency, test-retest and split-half reliability, and concurrent evidence of validity. Further, our results suggest that PNG-GNAT scores represent different underlying dimensions of S/R than explicit self-report measures, and incrementally predict mental health above and beyond self-report assessment. The PNG-GNAT appears to be an effective tool for measuring implicit positive/negative beliefs about God.

"The demands of tissue engineering have driven a tremendous amount of research effort in 3D tissue culture technology and, more recently, in 3D printing. The need to use 3D tissue culture techniques more broadly in all of cell biology is well-recognized, but the transition to 3D has been impeded by the convenience, effectiveness, and ubiquity of 2D culture materials, assays, and protocols, as well as the lack of 3D counterparts of these tools. Interestingly, progress and discoveries in 3D bioprinting research may provide the technical support needed to grow the practice of 3D culture. Here we investigate an integrated approach for 3D printing multicellular structures while using the same platform for 3D cell culture, experimentation, and assay development. We employ a liquid-like solid (LLS) material made from packed granular-scale microgels, which locally and temporarily fluidizes under the focused application of stress and spontaneously solidifies after the applied stress is removed. These rheological properties enable 3D printing of multicellular structures as well as the growth and expansion of cellular structures or dispersed cells. The transport properties of LLS allow molecular diffusion for the delivery of nutrients or small molecules for fluorescence-based assays. Here, we measure viability of 11 different cell types in the LLS medium, we 3D print numerous structures using several of these cell types, and we explore the transport properties in molecular time-release assays.

"Objective: Patients with ADHD have been suggested to have increased risks of allergic diseases but without consistent results, and limited studies about the association between ADHD and autoimmune diseases were noted in the literature. Method: Utilizing the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, ADHD patients were identified and compared with age- and gender-matched controls (1:4). Results: In all, 8,201 participants were identified as having ADHD, and an increased prevalence of allergic diseases, including asthma (odds ratio [OR] = 1.53), allergic rhinitis (OR = 1.59), atopic dermatitis (OR = 1.53), and urticaria (OR = 1.39), compared with the control group. Although the comorbidity of autoimmune diseases with ADHD was low, ADHD patients had a significantly greater prevalence of ankylosing spondylitis (OR = 2.78), ulcerative colitis (OR = 2.31), and autoimmune thyroid disease (OR = 2.53) than the controls. Conclusion: Our results supported the association between ADHD and allergic/autoimmune diseases. The further studies will be required to clarify the underlying mechanisms.

"Forecasting the output power of solar systems is required for the good operation of the power grid or for the optimal management of the energy fluxes occurring into the solar system. Before forecasting the solar systems output, it is essential to focus the prediction on the solar irradiance. The global solar radiation forecasting can be performed by several methods; the two big categories are the cloud imagery combined with physical models, and the machine learning models. In this context, the objective of this paper is to give an overview of forecasting methods of solar irradiation using machine learning approaches. Although, a lot of papers describes methodologies like neural networks or support vector regression, it will be shown that other methods (regression tree, random forest, gradient boosting and many others) begin to be used in this context of prediction. The performance ranking of such methods is complicated due to the diversity of the data set, time step, forecasting horizon, set up and performance indicators. Overall, the error of prediction is quite equivalent. To improve the prediction performance some authors proposed the use of hybrid models or to use an ensemble forecast approach.

"Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is associated with metastasis formation as well as with generation and maintenance of cancer stem cells. In this way, EMT contributes to tumor invasion, heterogeneity and chemoresistance. Morphological and functional changes involved in these processes require robust reprogramming of gene expression, which is only partially accomplished at the transcriptional level. Alternative splicing is another essential layer of gene expression regulation that expands the cell proteome. This step in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression tightly controls cell identity between epithelial and mesenchymal states and during stem cell differentiation. Importantly, dysregulation of splicing factor function and cancer-specific splicing isoform expression frequently occurs in human tumors, suggesting the importance of alternative splicing regulation for cancer biology. In this review, we briefly discuss the role of EMT programs in development, stem cell differentiation and cancer progression. Next, we focus on selected examples of key factors involved in EMT and stem cell differentiation that are regulated post-transcriptionally through alternative splicing mechanisms. Lastly, we describe relevant oncogenic splice-variants that directly orchestrate cancer stem cell biology and tumor EMT, which may be envisioned as novel targets for therapeutic intervention.

"Envelope tracking (ET) and envelope elimination and restoration (EER) are techniques that have gained in importance in the last decade in order to obtain highly efficient radio frequency power amplifier that transmits signals with high peak-to-average power ratio. In this study, a multilevel multiphase buck converter is presented as a solution for the envelope amplifier used in ET and EER. The presented multiphase buck converter generates multilevel voltage using node duty cycles and nonlinear control. In this way, the multilevel is implemented using only one simple power stage. However, the complexity of the multilevel converter implementation has been shifted from complicated power topologies to complicated digital control. Detailed discussion regarding the influence of the design parameters (switching frequency, output filter, and time resolution of the digital control) on the performance of the proposed envelope amplifier is presented. The design of the output filter is conducted fulfilling the constraints of the envelope slew rate and minimum driver pulse that can be reproduced. In the cases when these two constraints cannot be fulfilled, they may be relieved by the modified control that is presented and experimentally validated. Finally, in order to validate the concept, a prototype has been designed and integrated with a nonlinear class F amplifier. Efficiency measurements showed that by employing EER, it is possible to save up to 15% of power losses, comparing to the case when it is supplied by a constant voltage. Additionally, adjacent channel power ratio has been measured. The obtained results showed the value higher than 30 dB for signals up to 5 MHz of bandwidth, without using a predistortion technique.

"Purpose of the review The availability of the Children's Health Exposure Assessment Resource funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences provides new opportunities for exploring the role of tobacco smoke exposure in causing harm to children. Recent findings Children of smokers are exposed to nicotine and other harmful tobacco smoke chemicals in utero as well as in their environment. This passive exposure to tobacco smoke has a variety of negative effects on children. In-utero exposure to tobacco smoke causes poor birth outcomes and influences lung, cardiovascular, and brain development, placing children at increased risk of a number of adverse health outcomes later in life, such as obesity, behavioral problems, and cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, most smokers start in their adolescence, an age of increased nicotine addiction risk. Biomarkers of tobacco exposure helps clarify the role tobacco chemicals play in influencing health both in childhood and beyond. Although electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) appear to be a nicotine delivery device of reduced harm, it appears to be a gateway to the use of combustible cigarette smoking in adolescents. Summary Pediatric researchers interested in elucidating the role of tobacco smoke exposure in adverse outcomes in children should incorporate biomarkers of tobacco exposure in their studies.

"A modular typed dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) device is designed and tested for air and water remediation. The module is made of a number of DBD tubes that can be arranged in series or parallel. Each of the DBD tubes comprises inner electrode enclosed with dielectric barrier and arranged as such to provide a gap for the passage of gases. Non-thermal plasma generated in the gap effectively creates gaseous chemical reactions. Its efficacy in the remediation of gas stream containing high NOx, similar to diesel emission and wastewater containing latex, are presented. A six tubes DBD module has successfully removed more than 80% of nitric oxide from the gas stream. In another arrangement, oxygen was fed into a two tubes DBD to generate ozone for treatment of wastewater. Samples of wastewater were collected from a treatment pond of a rubber vulcanization pilot plant. The water pollution load was evaluated by the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biological oxygen demand (BOD5) values. Preliminary results showed some improvement (about 13%) on the COD after treatment and at the same time had increased the BOD5 by 42%. This results in higher BOD5/COD ratio after ozonation which indicate better biodegradability of the wastewater. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

"Food allergies have become a global challenge to food safety in industrialized countries in recent years. With governmental monitoring and legislation moving towards the establishment of threshold allergen doses, there is a need for sensitive and quantitative analytical methods for the determination of allergenic food contaminants. Targeted proteomics employing liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has emerged as a promising technique that offers increased specificity and reproducibility compared to antibody and DNA-based technologies. As the detection of trace levels of allergenic food contaminants also demands excellent sensitivity, we aimed to significantly increase the analytical performance of LC-MS by utilizing multiple reaction monitoring cubed (MRM3) technology. Following a bottom-up proteomics approach, including a straightforward sample preparation process, 38 MRM3 experiments specific to 18 proteotypic peptides were developed and optimized. This permitted the highly specific identification of peanut, almond, cashew, hazelnut, pistachio, and walnut. The analytical performance of the method was assessed for three relevant food matrices with different chemical compositions. Limits of detection were around 1 mu g/g or below in fortified matrix samples, not accounting for the effects of food processing. Compared to an MRM-based approach, the MRM3-based method showed an increase in sensitivity of up to 30-fold. Regression analysis demonstrated high linearity of the MRM3 signal in spiked matrix samples together with robust intersample reproducibility, confirming that the method is highly applicable for quantitative purposes. To the best of our knowledge, we describe here the most sensitive LC-MS multi-method for food allergen detection thus far. In addition, this is the first study that systematically compares MRM3 with MRM for the analysis of complex foods.

"Nitrate water pollution, which is mainly causedby agricultural activities, remains an international problem. It can cause serious long-term environmental and human health issues due to nitrate time-lag in the groundwater system. However, the nitrate subsurface legacy issue has rarely been considered in environmental water management. We have developed a simple catchment-scale approach to investigate the impact of historical nitrate loading from agricultural land on the nitrate-concentrationtrends in sandstones, which represent major aquifers in the Eden Valley, UK The model developed considers the spatio-temporal nitrate loading, low permeability superficial deposits, dual-porosity unsaturated zones, and nitrate dilution in aquifers. Monte Carlo simulations were undertaken to analyse parameter sensitivity and calibrate the model using observed datasets. Time series of annual average nitrate concentrations from 1925 to 2150 were generated for four aquifer zones in the study area. The results show that the nitrate concentrations in 'St Bees Sandstones', 'silicified Penrith Sandstones', and 'non-silicified Penrith Sandstones' keep rising or stay high before declining to stable levels, whilst that in 'inter-bedded Brockram Penrith Sandstones' will level off after a slight decrease. This study can help policymakers better understand local nitrate-legacy issues. It also provides a framework for informing the long-term impact and timescale of different scenarios introduced to deliver water-quality compliance. This model requires relatively modest parameterisation and is readily transferable to other areas. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

"Objectives. To evaluate partial remission during treatment with infliximab (IFX) + naproxen (NPX) vs NPX alone in patients from the two subgroups of SpA and explore baseline predictors of partial remission. Methods. Infliximab as First Line Therapy in Patients with Early Active Axial Spondyloarthritis Trial was a double-blind, randomised controlled trial of IFX in biologic-na < ve patients with early, active axial SpA. Patients were randomised (2:1) to receive 28 weeks of treatment with i.v. IFX 5 mg/kg (weeks 0, 2, 6, 12, 18 and 24) + NPX 1000 mg/day or i.v. placebo (PBO) + NPX 1000 mg/day. The current post hoc analysis evaluated outcomes in patients who did or did not meet modified New York radiographic criteria for AS. Results. The analysis included 94 patients who met AS criteria and 56 with non-radiographic axial SpA (nr-axSpA). At week 28, Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) partial remission was greater with IFX + NPX than PBO + NPX for both the AS group (70.5 vs 33.3%, respectively) and the nr-axSpA group (50.0 vs 37.5%, respectively). A similar pattern occurred with several efficacy measures. Larger treatment effects occurred in the AS group than the nr-axSpA group, possibly due to baseline differences in disease characteristics. Multivariable analyses identified the type of treatment, age and HLA-B27 status as predictors of ASAS partial remission in the total study population. MRI sacroiliac joint scores were associated with partial remission during IFX + NPX treatment. Conclusion. Patients with AS had greater partial remission with IFX + NSAID than NSAID therapy alone; patients with nr-axSpA had a smaller treatment effect. Baseline disease characteristics and age were associated with partial remission with IFX therapy.

"Rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems are increasingly being implemented in buildings. It is common in the UK for simple RWH tank sizing methods to be utilised, and these do not consider future climate change. This paper describes the development of a tool, which integrates elements of basic and detailed sizing approaches from the British Standard for RWH, with the latest probabilistic UK Climate Projections data. The method was initially applied to the design of a university building in Cornwall, UK. The methodology utilises 3,000 equi-probable rainfall patterns for tank sizing for each time period. Results indicate that, to ensure that it is 'likely' that the same non-potable demand could be met in 2080 as in the present, a tank 112% larger would be required. This increases to a 225% over-sizing for a 'very likely' probability of meeting the same level of non-potable demand. The same RWH system design was then assessed for three further UK locations with different rainfall characteristics. From these assessments, a simplified method was developed to enable practitioners to size RWH system tanks for current and future climates. The method provides a new approach to meet present and future non-potable demands, while preventing excessive over-sizing of tanks.

"Industrial waste heat may be one of the answers to future energy demands. Depending on the temperature, industrial waste heat may be used to produce electricity or meet cooling or heating demands at different temperature levels. However, in order to estimate the influence the waste heat may have in future energy systems, the magnitude of the industrial waste heat in the different countries need to be estimated. For Germany, so far, only top-down analyses of the waste heat potential exist, using key figures derived from other studies in other countries. In this paper, the first bottom-up approach for estimating the industrial waste heat potential in Germany is presented. For this approach, an algorithm to evaluate and test the mandatory emission report data from German production companies was developed. In a second step, round about 81,000 data sets have been evaluated to calculate a conservative and lower boundary value for the industrial waste heat. As this conservative, lower boundary based on the collected data from the German industry, the waste heat volume was evaluated as 127 PJ/a or 13 % of the industrial fuel consumption. Results were used to derive key figures with which the missing share of the data was approximated.

"Digital computers that automate manufacturing process are an important aspect for any manufacturing engineers in the modern world. Selection of the programming paradigm (PP), as well as the programming language (PL) that supports it, is crucial to ensure the correct ideas are being used to automate the solution of the problem. In current Malaysian Higher institution practices, various PPs and PLs courses are offered to current undergraduate manufacturing majors. An online survey was deployed to experienced manufacturing engineers from various manufacturing specializations in the industry. Graduates from one of Malaysia's public universities, International Islamic University Malaysia (HUM) have been chosen for this particular study. From the survey, it has been found that almost 80% of the participants agreed that PPs are important for manufacturing graduates. It was found out that 90% of the participants were from intermediate (scale of 3) until poor (scale of 1) to express their ability to explain PPs if asked. Only about 10% are able to explain on PPs (scale of 4 and 5). The study concluded that majority of the manufacturing graduates from HUM agreed that PP is an important subject to be taught in university. However, it was found the majority of the manufacturing graduates lack the knowledge and understanding of PPs and general PLs.

"Background: Glutaminase 1 is a phosphate-activated metabolic enzyme that catalyzes the first step of glutaminolysis, which converts glutamine into glutamate. Glutamate is the major neurotransmitter of excitatory synapses, executing important physiological functions in the central nervous system. There are two isoforms of glutaminase 1, KGA and GAC, both of which are generated through alternative splicing from the same gene. KGA and GAC both transcribe 1-14 exons in the N-terminal, but each has its unique C-terminal in the coding sequence. We have previously identified that KGA and GAC are differentially regulated during inflammatory stimulation and HIV infection. Furthermore, glutaminase 1 has been linked to brain diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and hepatic encephalopathy. Core enzyme structure of KGA and GAC has been published recently. However, how other coding sequences affect their functional enzyme activity remains unclear. Methods: We cloned and performed serial deletions of human full-length KGA and GAC from the N-terminal and the C-terminal at an interval of approximately 100 amino acids (AAs). Prokaryotic expressions of the mutant glutaminase 1 protein and a glutaminase enzyme activity assay were used to determine if KGA and GAC have similar efficiency and efficacy to convert glutamine into glutamate. Results: When 110 AAs or 218 AAs were deleted from the N-terminal or when the unique portions of KGA and GAC that are beyond the 550 AA were deleted from the C-terminal, KGA and GAC retained enzyme activity comparable to the full length proteins. In contrast, deletion of 310 AAs or more from N-terminal or deletion of 450 AAs or more from C-terminal resulted in complete loss of enzyme activity for KGA/GAC. Consistently, when both Nand C-terminal of the KGA and GAC were removed, creating a truncated protein that expressed the central 219 AA -550 AA, the protein retained enzyme activity. Furthermore, expression of the core 219 AA -550 AA coding sequence in cells increased extracellular glutamate concentrations to levels comparable to those of full-length KGA and GAC expressions, suggesting that the core enzyme activity of the protein lies within the central 219 AA -550 AA. Full-length KGA and GAC retained enzyme activities when kept at 4 degrees C. In contrast, 219 AA - 550 AA truncated protein lost glutaminase activities more readily compared with full-length KGA and GAC, suggesting that the N-terminal and C-terminal coding regions are required for the stability KGA and GAC. Conclusions: Glutaminase isoforms KGA and GAC have similar efficacy to catalyze the conversion of glutamine to glutamate. The core enzyme activity of glutaminase 1 protein is within the central 219 AA - 550 AA. The N-terminal and C-terminal coding regions of KGA and GAC help maintain the long-term activities of the enzymes.

"In current industrial practice, thousands of industrial alarms generating millions of alarm events, are built into digital control systems typically found in power generation facilities, power grid and communication networks, oil refineries, petrochemical plants, and other manufacturing plants. Given the increasing complexity of such systems, an effective approach to managing alarms and the stream of data they generate becomes imperative. Hitherto, much of alarm management techniques are mostly rule-based with intensive engineering domain expertise requiring an understanding of the underlying physical processes and special skills on the part of the plant operator. This paper describes a novel graph-based data mining approach that can be used to analyze industrial alarm data. Our method leverages the availability of large timestamped historical alarm events datasets. Using these historical datasets, we developed a graph analytics model that identifies redundant alarms and the series of alarms associated with or leading to critical events. Our experiments using real-world (a power generation station and an oil refinery) industrial alarm datasets demonstrate that our proposed method is both scalable and efficient.

"Treatment of cow's urine was first time explored in clayware microbial fuel cell (MFC) by varying dilution to have different chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the feed. Improvement in power output of MFC was attained with increase in feed concentration from 1.5 to 3 kg COD/m(3); however further increase in influent COD up to 30 kg COD/m(3) decreased the power. Maximum power of 5.23 W/m(3) was attained in MFC fed with diluted urine of cow with COD concentration of 3 kg COD/m(3), which was seven-fold higher than MFC fed with raw urine. Nitrate removal of 77 +/- 4.1% and carbohydrate removal of 80 +/- 3.9% were achieved in MFC fed with 3 kg COD/m(3). Electrochemical analysis showed that electrogenic activity of anodic biofilm boosted at optimum feed concentration (3 kg COD/m(3)) of cow's urine in anodic chamber. Using two MFCs, fed with diluted cow's urine, maximum voltage of 1.36 +/- 0.05 V in series connection and maximum current of 48 A/m(3) in parallel connection were achieved. Thus, cow's urine can serve as sustainable yellow gold to harvest bioelectricity using low cost clayware MFC, and to curb the water pollution likely caused from cattle sheds. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"The current study examines the Barack Obama presidency through the lens of racialized news framing and symbolic racism. Racial prejudice often manifests as subtle symbolic racism in so-called postracial America by supporting beliefs that racial minorities have gained undeserved advantage and are no longer discriminated against. Even when counter-stereotypic leaders such as President Obama from racial/ethnic minority groups are elected to positions of authority, they are subject to tokenism, heightened visibility, and racialized scrutiny in the media in ways that reinforce cultural stereotypes. The current study uses a between-participants experiment (N = 168) to examine how exposure to positive versus negative news frames of Obama have differential effects on White participants' symbolic racist beliefs. From a priming perspective, exposure to negative frames of President Obama is likely to activate underlying prejudicial feelings that lead to biased evaluations of African Americans as a whole. Using path analysis, the present study builds a causal chain of relationships that reveals that exposure to negative news frames of Obama as compared to positive ones activates readers' anti-Black affect, which in turn increases their symbolic racist beliefs. Implications of the findings for race/ethnic studies, political communication and journalism are discussed.

"The present study investigates the accuracy of five different data-driven techniques in estimating oxygen transfer efficiency in baffled chutes: feedforward neural network (FFNN), radial basis neural network (RBNN), generalized regression neural network (GRNN), adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system with subtractive clustering (ANFIS-SC), and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system with fuzzy c-means clustering (ANFIS-FCM). Baffled apron chutes or drops are used on channel structures to dissipate the energy in the flow. A baffled chute design is effective both in energy dissipation and in aerating the flow and reducing nitrogen supersaturation. There is a close relationship between energy dissipation and oxygen transfer efficiency. This study aims to determine the aeration efficiency of baffled chutes with stepped (S), wedge (W), trapezoidal (T), and T-shaped (T-S) baffle blocks. The performances of the FFNN, RBNN, GRNN, ANFIS-SC, and ANFIS-FCM models are compared with those of multilinear and nonlinear regression models. Based on the comparisons, it was observed that all data-driven models could be successfully employed in modeling the aeration efficiency of S, W, and T-S baffle blocks from the available experimental data. Among data-driven models, the FFNN model was found to be the best. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

"Scaling laws are used when the size of a certain machine design with known performance needs to be adjusted for a new application with known requirements, or when a machine design is geometrically scaled and one needs to determine its performance. Scaling laws derived in this study allow one to quickly and accurately recalculate parameters of a geometrically scaled permanent magnet machine. They basically consist of two separate important scaling procedures: axial scaling and radial scaling. The third and inevitable scaling procedure is rewinding, which is used to adjust the winding for a required voltage level. Exact but simple analytical equations for the various parameters (torque, power, losses, mass, resistance, inductance, efficiency etc.) of the machine are derived using three independent scaling factors, one for each scaling procedure. Special attention is given to the inclusion of end-winding influence and three-dimensional permanent magnet loss effects. Algorithms for fast determination of winding parameters for a given voltage and fast determination of scaling factors for scaling based on the torque requirement with stack length limitation are presented. All derived scaling equations are numerically validated using two state-of-the-art motor design software packages with automated extraction of parameters based on finite-element calculations.

"Pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) are the most lethal threat from volcanoes. While there are two main types of PDCs (fully turbulent, fully dilute pyroclastic surges and more concentrated pyroclastic flows encompassing non-turbulent to turbulent transport) pyroclastic flows, which are the subject of the present study, are far more complex than dilute pyroclastic surges and remain the least understood type despite their far greater hazard, greater runout length and ability to transport vast quantities of material across the Earth's surface. Here we present large-scale experiments of natural volcanic material and gas in order to provide the missing quantitative view of the internal structure and gas-particle transport mechanisms in pyroclastic flows. We show that the outer flow structure with head, body and wake regions broadly resembles current PDC analogues of dilute gravity currents. However, the internal structure, in which lower levels consist of a concentrated granular fluid and upper levels are more dilute, contrasts significantly with the internal structure of fully dilute gravity currents. This bipartite vertical structure shows strong analogy to current conceptual models of high-density turbidity currents, which are responsible for the distribution of coarse sediment in marine basins and of great interest to the hydrocarbon industry. The lower concentrated and non-turbulent levels of the PDC (granular-fluid basal flow) act as a fast flowing carrier for the more dilute and turbulent upper levels of the current (ash-cloud surge). Strong kinematic coupling between these flow parts reduces viscous dissipation and entrainment of ambient air into the lower part of the ash-cloud surge. This leads to a state of forced super-criticality whereby fast and destructive PDCs can endure even at large distances from volcanoes. Importantly, the basal flow/ash-cloud surge coupling yields a characteristically smooth rheological boundary across the non-turbulent/turbulent interface, as well as vertical velocity and density profiles in the ash-cloud surge, which strongly differ from current theoretical predictions. Observed generation of successive pulses of high dynamic pressure within the upper dilute levels of the PDC may be important to understand the destructive potential of PDCs. The experiments further show that a wide range in the degree of coupling between particle and gas phases is critical to the vertical and longitudinal segregation of the currents into reaches that have starkly contrasting sediment transport capacities. In particular, the formation of mesoscale turbulence clusters under strong particle-gas feedback controls vertical stratification inside the turbulent upper levels of the current (ash-cloud surge) and triggers significant transfers of mass and momentum from the ash-cloud surge onto the granular-fluid basal flow. These results open up new pathways to advance current computational PDC hazard models and to describe and interpret PDCs as well as other types of high-density gravity currents transported across the surfaces of Earth and other planets and across marine basins.

"Linux-based operating systems and runtimes (OS/Rs) have emerged as the environments of choice for the majority of HPC systems. While Linux-based OS/Rs have advantages such as extensive feature sets and developer familiarity, these features come at the cost of additional system overhead. In contrast to Linux, there is a substantial history of work in the HPC community focused on lightweight OS/Rs that provide scalable and consistent performance for HPC applications, but lack many of the features offered by commodity OS/Rs. In this paper, we propose to bridge the gap between LWKs and commodity OS/Rs by selectively providing a lightweight memory subsystem for HPC applications in a commodity OS/R where concurrently executing a diverse range of workloads is commonplace. Our system HPMMAP provides lightweight memory performance transparently to HPC applications by bypassing Linux's memory management layer. Using HPMMAP, HPC applications achieve consistent performance while the same local compute nodes execute competing workloads likely to be found in HPC clusters and in-situ workload deployments. Our approach is dynamically configurable at runtime, and requires no resources when not in use. We show that HPMMAP can decrease variance and reduce application runtime by up to 50 percent when executing a co-located competing commodity workload.

"The use of ethnic imagery in visual identities of brands, such as those used by professional sports franchises, has long been a contentious issue in American society. This research investigates the oft-voiced argument that ethnic brand imagery perpetuates negative stereotypes (a claim that has been subject to very little empirical scrutiny) and identifies conditions under which encountering such brand imagery strengthens both positive and negative implicit stereotypes. Within the context of American Indian brand imagery, two laboratory experiments (Studies 1 and 2) and a quasi experimental field study (Study 3) revealed that the effects of ethnic brand imagery on stereotypes depend on the viewer's political identity. Exposure to ethnic brand imagery strengthened implicit stereotypes only among more liberal individuals, consistent with the idea that liberals tend to hold more malleable views. These findings demonstrate measurable negative effects of ethnic brand imagery on implicit stereotypes and support the view that the use of such imagery can carry detrimental societal consequences.

"Positive energy residential buildings are houses that generate more energy from renewable sources than they consume while maintaining appropriate thermal comfort levels. However, their design, construction and operation present several critical challenges. In particular, the considerable load reductions are not always compatible with the increased level of comfort expected in modern houses. Tropical climates, meanwhile, should be more amenable to the implementation of positive energy houses for two reasons. Firstly, negligible heating is generally required as compared to colder climates, where the heating energy requirements are considerable. Then, renewable energy resources are usually abundant in tropical climates. This paper investigates the feasibility of positive energy residential buildings in the tropical island of Mauritius. A baseline model representing a typical Mauritian house is designed using DesignBuilder software. The energy efficiency of the model is then optimised by investigating a whole range of passive building design strategies, many of them adapted from vernacular architecture. Results reveal that the application of passive strategies such as shading, insulation and natural ventilation have precluded the need for artificial cooling and ventilation in the positive energy (PE) house. The resulting electricity consumption of the house decreases from 24.14 to 14.30 kWh/m(2)/year. A 1.2 kW photovoltaic system provides the most cost-effective solution to exceed the annual electricity requirements of the house.

"In the present article, we investigate the effects of specific nonverbal behaviors signaling dominance and submissiveness on impression formation and outcome expectation in the soccer penalty kick situation. In Experiment 1, results indicated that penalty takers with dominant body language are perceived more positively by soccer goalkeepers and players and are expected to perform better than players with a submissive body language. This effect was similar for both video and point-light displays. Moreover, in contrast to previous studies, we found no effect of clothing (red vs. white) in the video condition. In Experiment 2, we used the implicit association test to demonstrate that dominant body language is implicitly associated with a positive soccer player schema whereas submissive body language is implicitly associated with a negative soccer player schema. The implications of our findings are discussed with reference to future implications for theory and research in the study of person perception in sport.

"Worldwide natural gas consumption has increased significantly, especially for power generation in electricity systems with the gas-to-power (G2P) process of natural gas fired units. Supply for both natural gas and electricity systems should be dispatched economically and simultaneously due to their firm interconnection. This paper proposes a security-constrained bi-level economic dispatch (ED) model for integrated natural gas and electricity systems considering wind power and power-to-gas (P2G) process. The upper level is formulated as an ED optimization model for electricity system, while the lower level is an optimal allocation problem for natural gas system. Natural gas system is modeled in detail. In addition, the security constraints and coupling constraints for the integrated energy systems are considered. The objective function is to minimize the total production cost of electricity and natural gas. The lower model is converted and added into the upper model as Karush-Kuhn-Tucher (KKT) optimality conditions, thus the bi-level optimization model is transformed into a mix-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation. Numerical case studies on the PJM-5bus system integrated with a seven-node gas system and IEEE 118-bus system integrated with a modified Belgian high-calorific gas system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed bi-level ED model.

"Salix psammophila and Caragana korshinskii are two common shrubs in the southern Mu Us Desert, China. Their hydraulic strategies for adapting to this harsh, dry desert environment are not yet clear. This study examined the hydraulic transport efficiency, vulnerability to cavitation, and daily embolism refilling in the leaves and stems of these two shrubs during the dry season. In order to gain insight into water use strategies of whole plants, other related traits were also considered, including daily changes in stomatal conductance, leaf mass per area, leaf pressure-volume parameters, wood density and the Huber value. The leaves and stems of S. psammophila had greater hydraulic efficiency, but were more vulnerable to drought-induced hydraulic dysfunction than C. korshinskii. The difference between leaf and stem water potential at 50 % loss of conductivity was 0.12 MPa for S. psammophila and 0.81 MPa for C. korshinskii. Midday stomatal conductance decreased by 74 % compared to that at 8:30 in S. psammophila, whereas no change occurred in C. korshinskii. Daily embolism and refilling occurred in the stems of S. psammophila and leaves of C. korshinskii. These results suggest that a stricter stomatal regulation, daily embolism repair in stems, and a higher stem water capacitance could be partially compensating for the greater susceptibility to xylem embolism in S. psammophila, whereas higher leaf elastic modulus, greater embolism resistance in stems, larger difference between leaf and stem hydraulic safety, and drought-induced leaf shedding in C. korshinskii were largely responsible for its more extensive distribution in arid and desert steppes.

"Background and Objectives: Adolescence-related increases in both anxiety and risk taking may originate in variability in Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU), rendering the study of IU of importance. We therefore studied the psychometric properties of the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale Short version (IUS-12), including its associations with trait anxiety and risk taking, among adolescents. Methods: A sample of 879 Dutch adolescents, from diverse educational levels, and with an equal distribution of boys and girls, was classically tested. To obtain indices of IU, and self-reported trait anxiety and need for risk taking, questionnaires were administrated; to obtain an index of risk taking behavior, adolescents performed a risk taking task. Results: Multi-group Confirmatory Factor Analyses revealed that the IUS-12 consists of a Prospective and an Inhibitory IU subscale, which are partially measurement invariant across sex. Cronbach's alphas and item-total correlations revealed that the IUS-12 and its subscales have reasonable-to-good internal consistency. Correlational analyses support convergent validity, as higher IUS-12 scores were related to, respectively, higher and lower levels of self-reported trait anxiety and need for risk taking. However, we found no relationship between IUS-12 scores and risk taking behavior, operationalized by performance on the risk taking task. Limitations: A community, instead of clinical, sample was included. Also, IU was measured by a paper and -pencil version of the IUS-12, instead of a computerized version. Conclusions: The IUS-12 has good psychometric properties and may be a central measure to assess IU, which enables to explain the adolescence-related increase in both anxiety and risk taking.

"Chronic health conditions of the elderly lead to limitations in physical activity with disability, anxiety, and increased need for medical care and assisted living conditions. Physical performance tests are used to screen for pending loss of mobility and can serve as endpoints to monitor the effectiveness of intervention measures. Since limited mobility is associated with the physical and mental health of a person, evaluation of this in preclinical aging studies in mice will provide a translational approach for testing new intervention strategies. We assessed physiological parameters in 4, 12, 20 and 28 month old C57BL/6 and CB6F1 male mice using a rotating rod, a free running wheel, and a photo beam activity field, designed to determine changes in coordinated walking ability, self-motivated running distance, and anxiety response to a novel environment, respectively. Older mice showed decreased coordinated walking times and decreased running distances, predictive of physical performance ability and motivation in the elderly. Changes in both lateral and vertical movements were observed in a novel cage environment suggesting different levels of anxiety. Because the genetic background of the two mouse strains influenced test results in an age-dependent manner, it is imperative to recognize that diverse genetic backgrounds in mice may yield different data in preclinical studies and would need to be interpreted individually for translational applications.

"The Internet of Things is a natural continuity of the Ambient Intelligence where smart and ambient environments are built by integrating a large number of interconnected smart objects with heterogeneous capabilities abstracted as software services. The aim is to design cross-domain applications that compose and select most relevant services, which best match user requirements and closely meet the specified quality-of-service level. However, semantic description and representation of such smart devices, including their hosted services and their provided real world data, is still a challenging issue. Semantic Web technologies are seen as a promising tool for this purpose. Indeed, applying these technologies in the Internet of Things enables smart objects to efficiently share their data, exchange their services and cooperate to better satisfy both functional and non-functional user requirements. In this paper, we propose a new semantic model for smart objects description and users request resolution using ontological techniques combined with description logics. Such a model facilitates intelligent functions, including reasoning over service data and semantic interoperability enabling among devices. A case study for smart environment monitoring has been proposed to illustrate the effectiveness and usability of our approach. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

"Seed dehydration is the normal terminal event in the development of orthodox seeds and is physiologically related to the cessation of grain dry mass accumulation and crop grain yield. For a better understanding of grain dehydration, we evaluated the hypothesis that hydraulic conductance of the ear decreases during the latter stages of development and that this decrease results from disruption or occlusion of xylem conduits. Whole ear, rachis, and stem nodes hydraulic conductance and percentage loss of xylem conductivity were measured from flowering to harvest-ripeness on bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cv. Recital grown under controlled environments. Flag leaf transpiration, stomatal conductance, chlorophyll content and grain and ear water potentials were also measured during grain development. We show that grain dehydration was not related with whole plant physiology and leaf senescence, but closely correlated with the hydraulic properties of the xylem conduits irrigating the grains. Indeed, there was a substantial decrease in rachis hydraulic conductance at the onset of the grain dehydration phase. This hydraulic impairment was not caused by the presence of air embolism in xylem conduits of the stern internodes or rachis but by the occlusion of the xylem lumens by polysaccharides (pectins and callose). Our results demonstrate that xylem hydraulics plays a key role during grain maturation.

"As mobile social networks (MSNs) are booming and gaining tremendous popularity, there have been an increasing number of communications and interactions among users. Taking this advantage, users in MSNs make decisions via collecting and combining trust information from different users. Hence, trust evaluation technology has become a key requirement for network security in MSNs. In such MSNs, however, the community/group structures are dynamically changing, and users may belong to multiple communities/groups. Therefore, trust evaluation plays a critical role in inferring trustworthy contacts among users. In this paper, an innovative trust inference model is proposed for MSNs, in which multiple dimensional trust metrics are incorporated to reflect the complexity of trust. To infer trust relations between users in MSNs with complex communities, we first construct dynamic implicit social behavioral graphs (DynISBG) based on dynamic complex community/group structures and propose an efficient detection algorithm for DynISBG under fuzzy degree kappa. We then present a multi-dimensional fuzzy trust inferring approach that involves four metrics, that is, static attribute trust factor, dynamic behavioral trust factor, long-term trust evolution factor, and recommendation-based trust opinion. Moreover, to obtain the recommendation-based trust opinion about indirect connected users, we discuss the trust aggregation and propagation along trust path. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our novel approach with simulations. The results show that, compared with the existing approaches, the proposed model provides a more detailed analysis in trust evaluation with higher accuracy. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

"Adenoviruses cause a variety of diseases that range from mild to fatal in vulnerable patients. Its evolution occurs as a process of selection pressure; for example, genetic recombination generates intermediate strains that can be more infectious or pathogenic than parental strains. This study sought to determine the diversity of circulating adenoviruses in Paraguayan children less than 5 years of age hospitalized with acute lower respiratory infection, by using molecular biology and bioinformatics tools, though amplification of penton, hexon and fiber genes in 26 samples of nasopharyngeal aspirates. It was demonstrated the circulation of three species: B (4/26), C (21/26), and D (1/26), as well as recombination events corresponding to the HAdV-D isolate, with at least three different genotypes (D49, D9 y D15). The HAdV-D are associated with gastrointestinal or ocular diseases, and less commonly with respiratory infections. Recently, however, it has been reported changes in behavior of these viruses due to recombination, allowing them to expand their host cell repertoire. These data extend the knowledge about the genetic diversity of HAdV in Paraguay and strongly support the importance of genomic analysis using bioinformatics tools in epidemiological surveillance of emerging recombinant strains of HAdV.

The Level 2 radiometer-only soil moisture product (L2_SM_P) provides soil moisture estimates posted on a 36-km Earth-fixed grid using brightness temperature observations from descending passes. This paper provides the first comparison of the validated-release L2_SM_P product with soil moisture products provided by the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), Aquarius, Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT), and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) missions. This comparison was conducted as part of the SMAP calibration and validation efforts. SMAP and SMOS appear most similar among the five soil moisture products considered in this paper, overall exhibiting the smallest unbiased root-mean-square difference and highest correlation. Overall, SMOS tends to be slightly wetter than SMAP, excluding forests where some differences are observed. SMAP and Aquarius can only be compared for a little more than two months; they compare well, especially over low to moderately vegetated areas. SMAP and ASCAT show similar overall trends and spatial patterns with ASCAT providing wetter soil moistures than SMAP over moderate to dense vegetation. SMAP and AMSR2 largely disagree in their soil moisture trends and spatial patterns; AMSR2 exhibits an overall dry bias, while desert areas are observed to be wetter than SMAP.

"For thermal mixed-convection flows, the Nusselt number is a function of Reynolds number, Grashof number and the angle between the forced-and natural-convection directions. We consider flow over a heated cylinder for which there is no universal correlation that accurately predicts Nusselt number as a function of these parameters, especially in opposing-convection flows, where the natural convection is against the forced convection. Here, we revisit this classical problem by employing modern tools from machine learning to develop a general multi-fidelity framework for constructing a stochastic response surface for the Nusselt number. In particular, we combine previously developed experimental correlations (low-fidelity model) with direct numerical simulations (high-fidelity model) using Gaussian process regression and autoregressive stochastic schemes. In this framework the high-fidelity model is sampled only a few times, while the inexpensive empirical correlation is sampled at a very high rate. We obtain the mean Nusselt number directly from the stochastic multi-fidelity response surface, and we also propose an improved correlation. This new correlation seems to be consistent with the physics of this problem as we correct the vectorial addition of forced and natural convection with a pre-factor that weighs differently the forced convection. This, in turn, results in a new definition of the effective Reynolds number, hence accounting for the 'incomplete similarity' between mixed convection and forced convection. In addition, due to the probabilistic construction, we can quantify the uncertainty associated with the predictions. This information-fusion framework is useful for elucidating the physics of the flow, especially in cases where anomalous transport or interesting dynamics may be revealed by contrasting the variable fidelity across the models. While in this paper we focus on the thermal mixed convection, the multi-fidelity framework provides a new paradigm that could he used in many different contexts in fluid mechanics including heat and mass transport, but also in combining various levels of fidelity of models of turbulent flows.

"The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of a passive point-of-use treatment system, namely, a polyvinyl (alcohol) (PVA) nanofiber membrane/activated carbon column, for the treatment of harvested rainwater. The efficiency of SMI-Q10 [quaternized poly (styrene-co-maleimide)] nanofiber membrane disks placed in a filtration assembly for the treatment of surface water (Plankenburg River, Western Cape, South Africa) and harvested rainwater was also assessed. Two rainwater harvesting tanks were installed at the Welgevallen Experimental farm, Stellenbosch, South Africa, with the filtration system intermittently attached to the tanks for collection of rainwater samples throughout the study period. Parameters used to monitor the filtration systems included heterotrophic bacteria, Escherichia coli, and total coliform enumeration and the presence/absence of adenovirus. When compared to drinking water guidelines, the results indicated that 3 L of potable water could be produced by the synthesized PVA nanofiber membrane/activated carbon column. However, PCR assays indicated that adenovirus and numerous bacteria such as Klebsiella spp., Legionella spp., Pseudomonas spp., and Yersinia spp. were not effectively removed by the filtration system utilized. Additionally, the SMI-Q10 nanofiber membrane disks did not remove viruses from the river or tank water samples as bovine adenovirus 3 strain, simian adenovirus, and human adenovirus A strain were detected in all water samples analyzed. Thus, while the microfiltration system was efficient in reducing the level of indicator organisms to within drinking water standards, further optimization of the electrospun filtration membranes is required as molecular analysis revealed that numerous opportunistic bacterial pathogens and viruses persisted after filtration.

Variations in individual characteristics (age and gender), military family factors (rank, recent deployment, parents' resilient coping abilities) and family relational characteristics (parents' marital status, warm parenting, marital quality) were related to heterogeneous worry typologies. Depressive symptoms, self-efficacy and well-being, varied across the worry typologies. Implications are drawn from these findings for identifying potential interventions that can be accessed to modify these worry patterns and limit their harmful effects.

"Nitrate (NO3 (-)) pollution is a severe problem in urban aquatic systems especially within megacity undergoing rapid urbanization, and mostly, sewage is supposed as the prevailing NO3 (-) source. A dual isotope approach (delta N-15-NO3 (-) and delta O-18-NO3 (-)) was applied to explore the variation in NO3 (-) isotopic signatures in sewage processed by wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Beijing from 2014 to 2015. We found that the raw and treated sewage owned the different NO3 (-) isotopic signatures, including delta N-15 from 1.1 to 24.7 aEuro degrees and delta O-18 from 1.6 to 22.8 aEuro degrees in raw sewage, as well as delta N-15 from 6.1 to 22.8 aEuro degrees and delta O-18 from 1.6 to 13.2 aEuro degrees in treated effluents. The WWTP processing would result in the enrichment of NO3 (-) isotopic compositions in discharged effluents with NO3 (-) concentrations increasing. Besides, advanced sewage treatment technology with more pollutant N reduction may raise the heavier NO3 (-) isotopic compositions further. The NO3 (-) isotope value ranges of urban sewage and manure should be separated, and the seasonal and tighter NO3 (-) isotope value ranges are supposed to improve the accuracy of source apportionment. The NO3 (-) isotope value ranges conducted in this study might provide useful information for tracing NO3 (-) sources towards the implementation of efficient water pollution control in Beijing.

"To face the challenges of urbanization and climate change in Morocco, within the initiative of the Department of Water, we started working recently on the development of rainwater harvesting (RWH). The Bouskoura basin is the pilot site selected, because an integrated water resources management (IWRM) approach may be considered due to rapid urbanization and industrialization, and hosting wide facilities such as airport, highway, many expanding urban areas promotion and including 64% of rural areas. Hydrological modeling was carried out through HEC-HMS model for the reconstitution of theoretical natural hydrograph because of the lack of hydrological measurements and STORM model to study the integrated effect of the water harvesting facilities on the socio-economic and environmental aspects of the basin and its relationships with its environment. Continuous simulations are made based on data from climate models re analysis because of the lack of ground measured climate data. Modeling was used to measure the impact of storm-water on the environment in general and on the hydrological cycle in particular including mitigation of flood magnitudes, the substantial drinking water costs reduction, the impact obtained from watering green spaces, the artificial recharge of the aquifer and the reduction of greenhouse effect gas emissions. We need to put emphasis on the fact that these in situ IWRM developed in this case, can lead to creation of smart spaces from smart projects through smart cities to smart watersheds. The results are promising and show that flood mitigation for the Bouskoura basin is 46% of the peak flow. The other advantages are of useful importance in domestic use, infiltration to the aquifer, etc. The impacts for each unit such as airport, roads, administrative or industrial buildings are measured in this case. We can conclude that if more space is urbanized more the impact is important. The information carried out will provide in the future a decision support system to monitor sustainable urbanization development in the basin.

"This study aimed to examine the associations of individual trajectories of three types of negative affect (NA: anxiety, depression, and anger) and craving during a 44-day period of incentivized smoking abstinence period with cessation outcome at 3 months and at 1 year. Adult smokers (N = 140) completed questionnaire assessments of NA and craving during pre-quit baseline sessions and 15 postquit sessions over the 45 days of biochemically verified abstinence while on nicotine or placebo patch treatment. Growth curve and logistic regression analyses were used to examine the associations of trajectory parameters of the individual NA states and craving with the abstinence outcomes at 3 months and 1 year postquit. Greater declines in anxiety, depression, and anger symptoms over the first 44 days of smoking cessation were predictive of higher odds of abstinence at both 3 months and 1 year. Moreover, the greater declines in anxiety and anger remained as significant predictors of abstinence at both time points, independent of the predictive ability of the trajectory profiles of craving. The findings suggest that slower dissipation of NA, especially anxiety and anger, represents a greater risk for relapse to smoking beyond that predicted by craving during early abstinence. Thus, temporal profiles of the affective symptoms convey unique motivational significance in relapse. Reduction in NA during early abstinence may be a valid target for interventions to increase long-term cessation success rates particularly among individuals with refractory affective symptoms.

"The challenge of studying human cognitive evolution is identifying unique features of our intelligence while explaining the processes by which they arose. Comparisons with nonhuman apes point to our early-emerging cooperative-communicative abilities as crucial to the evolution of all forms of human cultural cognition, including language. The human self-domestication hypothesis proposes that these early-emerging social skills evolved when natural selection favored increased in-group prosociality over aggression in late human evolution. As a by-product of this selection, humans are predicted to show traits of the domestication syndrome observed in other domestic animals. In reviewing comparative, developmental, neurobiological, and paleoanthropological research, compelling evidence emerges for the predicted relationship between unique human mentalizing abilities, tolerance, and the domestication syndrome in humans. This synthesis includes a review of the first a priori test of the self-domestication hypothesis as well as predictions for future tests.

"The excellent features of bearing vibration signal are helpful to obtain accurate diagnosis results for the failure of bearing. In this study, the feature extraction method of bearing vibration signal based on wavelet packet transform-phase space reconstruction-singular value decomposition (WPS) is presented to improve the traditional feature extraction method of bearing vibration signal based on wavelet packet transform-singular value decomposition (WS). In the proposed feature extraction method, singular value decomposition is performed for phase space reconstruction signal of each wavelet packet coefficient's reconstructed signal of bearing vibration signal. The dynamic characteristics of a certain frequency range can be reflected by phase space reconstruction for wavelet packet coefficients' reconstructed signals of bearing vibration signal. Support vector machine (SVM) is a machine learning method based on structural risk minimization principle, and SVM classifier can solve the classification problems with small training samples, high dimensions, and nonlinearity. Thus, the SVM model of bearing is established by the features of bearing vibration signal based on wavelet packet transform-phase space reconstruction-singular value decomposition in this study. The experimental results show that the feature extraction method of bearing vibration signal based on wavelet packet transform-phase space reconstruction-singular value decomposition is better than the feature extraction method of bearing vibration signal based on wavelet packet transform-singular value decomposition, and SVM established by the features of bearing vibration signal based on wavelet packet transform-phase space reconstruction-singular value decomposition (WPS-SVM) has a stronger fault diagnosis ability of bearing than SVM established by the features of bearing vibration signal based on wavelet packet transform-singular value decomposition (WS-SVM).

"In this paper, the authors discussed in detail about the framework of integrating Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) with Building Information Modeling (BIM) technologies. The proposed framework can be used in the computer-aided design, manufacturing, engineering, and installation processes. In specific, this paper explained how to use RFID technology for structural steel components, such as a steel beam or column. The paper discussed the framework of the decision support system to transmit data read from RFID, retrieve the requested information, integrate the information in analysis process, and update the BIM project model when a decision is reached. The suggested result would have great potential of saving installation time, decrease cost, improve safety record, or achieve better quality in the end of the construction process.

"Children must sometimes decide between conforming to peer behavior and doing what is right. While research shows that children have a strong inclination to act prosocially and to help conspecifics in need, many studies also demonstrate that children tend to adopt peer behavior. In two studies (N = 96), we investigated whether children would conform to an antisocial majority or, whether they would do the right thing even under peer pressure. Results show that if a recipient is in need, 5-year-old children act prosocially in two different contexts even when there is a strong selfish incentive not to. However, once the severity of the recipient's need is reduced, children conform to the antisocial group. The current studies suggest that children's prosocial motivation sometimes wins out against more selfish drives. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

"Background. Blunted facial affect is a common negative symptom of schizophrenia. Additionally, assessing the trustworthiness of faces is a social cognitive ability that is impaired in schizophrenia. Currently available pharmacological agents are ineffective at improving either of these symptoms, despite their clinical significance. The hypothalamic neuropeptide oxytocin has multiple prosocial effects when administered intranasally to healthy individuals and shows promise in decreasing negative symptoms and enhancing social cognition in schizophrenia. Although two small studies have investigated oxytocin's effects on ratings of facial trustworthiness in schizophrenia, its effects on facial expressivity have not been investigated in any population. Method. We investigated the effects of oxytocin on facial emotional expressivity while participants performed a facial trustworthiness rating task in 33 individuals with schizophrenia and 35 age-matched healthy controls using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design. Participants rated the trustworthiness of presented faces interspersed with emotionally evocative photographs while being video-recorded. Participants' facial expressivity in these videos was quantified by blind raters using a well-validated manualized approach (i.e. the Facial Expression Coding System; FACES). Results. While oxytocin administration did not affect ratings of facial trustworthiness, it significantly increased facial expressivity in individuals with schizophrenia (Z=-2.33, p=0.02) and at trend level in healthy controls (Z=-1.87, p=0.06). Conclusions. These results demonstrate that oxytocin administration can increase facial expressivity in response to emotional stimuli and suggest that oxytocin may have the potential to serve as a treatment for blunted facial affect in schizophrenia.

"Virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) solutions seek to provide a satisfactory user experience at the client side when accessing remote desktop applications, even from mobile devices with limited capabilities. This paper presents a new approach, improving on previous work by the authors, in which a combination of Virtual Network Computing (VNC) and streaming protocols allowed efficient remote web access to virtualized applications within a cloud architecture. The new approach simplifies virtual machine templates, from which virtual machine instances are deployed, by centralizing software modules, greatly simplifying their management. Our new contribution consists of an integrated solution with specific WebM video encoding modules in charge of application visual output processing, an Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) streaming server, and a VNC server. The solution can be installed in the hypervisor of the host machines instead of replicating the servers and modules throughout the guest (virtual) machines that run the virtualized applications. Consequently, their implementations are unique and independent of the operating system of the virtual machines. In short, it is not necessary to provide different implementations for different operating systems, which reduces the complexity of virtual machine templates and greatly simplies platform management. To demonstrate our solution, we have modified the Quick Emulator (QEMU)-Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor source code accordingly. We also present qualitative and quantitative analyses that demonstrate that the new approach is advantageous in terms of software management and quality of experience, compared with our previous work and other well-known thin clients, contributing to the enhancement of VDI systems.

"As the course of computer operating system requires students to understand the interactions between computer systems, users and hardware platform, this paper concentrates on the problem of using the virtualization technology in computer operating system teaching. Particularly, virtualization technology is designed to simulate the real computer hardware environment, and then make the operating system run in a virtual computer environment. Because the virtual machine software can simulate real computer hardware equipment, several operating systems are supported, such as Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Unix etc. The main idea of this paper is to utilize the VMware software in operating system teaching. VMware provides a completely virtualized set of hardware for a specific operating system. Afterwards, we discuss how to design and implement an experimental platform with multiple operating systems based on VMware.

"Objective: Patient-physician communication is essential for patient-centered health care. Physicians are concerned that electronic health records (EHRs) negatively affect communication with patients. This study identified a framework for understanding communication functions that influence patient outcomes. We then conducted a systematic review of the literature and organized it within the framework to better understand what is known. Method: A comprehensive search of three databases (CINAHL, Medline, PsycINFO) yielded 41 articles for analysis. Results: Results indicated that EHR use improves capture and sharing of certain biomedical information. However, it may interfere with collection of psychosocial and emotional information, and therefore may interfere with development of supportive, healing relationships. Patient access to the EHR and messaging functions may improve communication, patient empowerment, engagement, and self-management. Conclusion: More rigorous examination of EHR impacts on communication functions and their influences on patient outcomes is imperative for achieving patient-centered care. By focusing on the role of communication functions on patient outcomes, future EHRs can be developed to facilitate care. Practice implications: Training alone is likely to be insufficient to address disruptions to communication processes. Processes must be improved, and EHRs must be developed to capture useful data without interfering with physicians' and patients' abilities to effectively communicate. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

"A series of SiO2@aluminum-MOF(MIL-68) composites with different SiO2 loadings have been synthesized by a simple and mild compositing strategy for high-efficiency removal of aniline. As evidenced from SEM and TEM images as well as the particle size distribution, the incorporation of SiO2 can improve the dispersity of MIL-68(Al) in composites, and result in the smaller particle size than that of pristine MIL-68(Al). Besides, the adsorption of aniline over SiO2, MIL-68(Al), the physical mixture of these two materials, and SiO2@MIL-68(Al) composites was investigated comparatively, demonstrating a relatively high adsorption capacity (531.9 mg g(-1)) of 7% SiO2@MIL-68(Al) towards aniline. Combining the ultrafast adsorption dynamics (reaching equilibrium within 40 s) and great reusability, 7% SiO2@MIL-68(Al) shows excellent adsorption performance. This indicates that the SiO2@MIL-68(Al) composites possess great potential applications as a kind of fascinating adsorbent in water pollution protection. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"Magnesium (Mg) is naturally found in bone tissue and is essential to human metabolism. It is well known that Mg ion improved bone-like apatite nucleation and growth. In this study, Mg ions were ion exchanged onto poly acrylic acid (PAA) thin film containing the carboxyl groups deposited on the commercially pure titanium (CP-Ti) surface using a plasma polymerization at discharge power 50 W for 5 min. Surface morphology and chemical composition of all samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Bioactivity of the Mg ion exchanged CP-Ti samples was evaluated by immersing in simulated body fluid (SBF) and MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation. The bone-like apatite forming ability was significantly influenced by Mg ion concentrations. Mg ion promotes bone-like apatite nucleation and growth on CP-Ti surface in SBF solution and improves MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation. It is therefore expected that CP-Ti and Ti alloys having a high biocompatibility can be obtained by ion exchanging the Mg ion after PAA plasma modified Ti surface. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

"Bioretention cells (BRCs) are an increasingly popular Stormwater Control Measure used to mitigate the hydrologic and water quality impacts of urbanization. Previous BRC research has demonstrated a strong capacity for pollutant removal; however, long-term sequestration of pollutants within soil media can elevate concentrations to levels fostering environmental and human health risks. Soil media samples were collected from an 11 year-old BRC in Charlotte, NC, and analyzed for the accumulation and spatial distribution of zinc, copper, and phosphorus. Pollutant distribution varied significantly with respect to depth and ordinate distance from the BRC inlet. Zinc concentrations (0.9-228.6 mg kg(-1) soil) exceeded environmental thresholds and phosphorus concentrations (5.1-173.3 mg kg(-1) soil) increased from initial levels by a factor of seven; however, notable accumulation was restricted to the BRC forebay. Maximum zinc and copper concentrations in soil media did not exceed 1% of mandatory cleanup levels and with regular maintenance of the forebay, the effective life of BRC media should exceed the life of the developments they treat.

"This paper aims to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) tool for rainwater harvesting (RWH) on a university campus in Bogota, Colombia. The specific type of MCDA our research proposes is known as CRIDE (multi-CRIteria DEcision support tool), which allows us to study various methods of RWH. In order to account for uncertainties such as the variability of expert opinions and imprecision stemming from the different criteria required, we have designed this tool to incorporate ELECTRE II and the Monte Carlo method. For this case study we apply a methodology that evaluates the performance of six RWH scenarios. These six input scenarios emerged from an ideal one, wherein all rainwater throughout the campus is successfully harvested and treated until potable. From there, reality sets in: the other five scenarios are varying degrees of deviance from the ideal one, both in terms of water quantity and quality. In regard to collection and treatment we used sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS). As for the evaluation of each of the scenarios, we outline eight criteria, which include hydraulic performance, compatibility with the University's Master Plan and financial aspects. Our research concludes that CRIDE as a means of support during the decision-making process generates a complete view of possible solutions, in addition to ranking these solutions. The CRIDE-based approach allows for the proposal of a methodology that evaluates the relevance of an established criteria set, using robustness, redundancy and sensitivity.

"Airborne Lidar bathymetry (ALB) is an effective and a rapidly advancing technology for mapping and characterizing shallow coastal water zones as well as inland fresh-water basins such as rivers and lakes. The ability of light beams to detect and traverse shallow water columns has provided valuable information about unmapped and often poorly understood coastal and inland water bodies of the world. Estimating ALB survey results at varying water clarity and depth conditions is essential for realizing project expectations and preparing budgets accordingly. In remote locations of the world where in situ water clarity measurements are not feasible or possible, using multiband satellite imagery can be an effective tool for estimating and addressing such considerations. For this purpose, we studied and classified reflected electromagnetic energy from selected water bodies acquired by RapidEye sensor and then correlated findings with ALB survey results. This study was focused not on accurately measuring depth from optical bathymetry but rather on using multiband satellite imagery to quickly predict ALB survey results and identify potentially turbid water bodies with limited depth penetration. For this study, we constructed an in-house algorithm to confirm ALB survey findings using bathymetric waveform information. The study findings are expected to contribute to the ongoing understanding of forecasting ALB survey expectations in unknown and varying water conditions, especially in remote and inaccessible parts of the world.

"Introduction. There is a debate about the ability of patients with Alzheimer's disease to build an up-to-date representation of their memory function, which has been termed mnemonic anosognosia. This form of anosognosia is typified by accurate online evaluations of performance, but dysfunctional or outmoded representations of function more generally. Method. We tested whether people with Alzheimer's disease could adapt or change their representations of memory performance across three different six-week memory training programs using global judgements of learning. Results. We showed that whereas online assessments of performance were accurate, patients continued to make inaccurate overestimations of their memory performance. This was despite the fact that the magnitude of predictions shifted according to the memory training. That is, on some level patients showed an ability to change and retain a representation of performance over time, but it was a dysfunctional one. For the first time in the literature we were able to use an analysis using correlations to support this claim, based on a large heterogeneous sample of 51 patients with Alzheimer's disease. Conclusion. The results point not to a failure to retain online metamemory information, but rather that this information is never used or incorporated into longer term representations, supporting but refining the mnemonic anosognosia hypothesis.

"Empathy for pain is often described as automatic. Here, we used implicit measurement and multinomial modeling to formally quantify unintentional empathy for pain: empathy that occurs despite intentions to the contrary. We developed the pain identification task (PIT), a sequential priming task wherein participants judge the painfulness of target experiences while trying to avoid the influence of prime experiences. Using multinomial modeling, we distinguished 3 component processes underlying PIT performance: empathy toward target stimuli (Intentional Empathy), empathy toward prime stimuli (Unintentional Empathy), and bias to judge target stimuli as painful (Response Bias). In Experiment 1, imposing a fast (vs. slow) response deadline uniquely reduced Intentional Empathy. In Experiment 2, inducing imagine-self (vs. imagine-other) perspective-taking uniquely increased Unintentional Empathy. In Experiment 3, Intentional and Unintentional Empathy were stronger toward targets with typical (vs. atypical) pain outcomes, suggesting that outcome information matters and that effects on the PIT are not reducible to affective priming. Typicality of pain outcomes more weakly affected task performance when target stimuli were merely categorized rather than judged for painfulness, suggesting that effects on the latter are not reducible to semantic priming. In Experiment 4, Unintentional Empathy was stronger for participants who engaged in costly donation to cancer charities, but this parameter was also high for those who donated to an objectively worse but socially more popular charity, suggesting that overly high empathy may facilitate maladaptive altruism. Theoretical and practical applications of our modeling approach for understanding variation in empathy are discussed.

"Single-component nonrelativistic dissipative fluids are treated independently of reference frames and flow-frames. First the basic fields and their balances are derived, then the related thermodynamic relations and the entropy production are calculated and the linear constitutive relations are given. The usual basic fields of mass, momentum, energy and their current densities, the heat flux, pressure tensor and diffusion flux are the time- and spacelike components of the third-order mass-momentum-energy density-flux four-tensor. The corresponding Galilean transformation rules of the physical quantities are derived. It is proved that the non-equilibrium thermodynamic frame theory, including the thermostatic Gibbs relation and extensivity condition and also the entropy production, is independent of the reference frame and also the flow-frame of the fluid. The continuity-Fourier-Navier-Stokes equations are obtained almost in the traditional form if the flow of the fluid is fixed to the temperature. This choice of the flow-frame is the thermo-flow. A simple consequence of the theory is that the relation between the total, kinetic and internal energies is a Galilean transformation rule.

"The relative age effect (RAE) is a well-established phenomenon in education and sports. Coaches have been assumed to be important social agents of RAE via biased selection decisions in favour of children with maturation advantages. In the present research, we used the Implicit Association Test to investigate automatic associations between body size and a player's domain-specific giftedness amongst youth baseball (N= 18) and youth soccer coaches (N= 34). We found medium to strong automatic associations between body size and player giftedness (baseball: M-D= 0.62; soccer: M-D= 0.51). Specifically, taller players were associated with positive performance-related attributes, whereas smaller players were associated with negative attributes. The results are in line with theories of grounded cognition by showing that the abstract concept of sport giftedness is partly grounded in the perception of physical height amongst youth sports coaches. We argue that this grounded cognition has the potential to influence coaches' selection decisions and in turn account for RAE as coaches are biased towards physically more matured players, even when no apparent performance advantage is evident.

"Coral reefs provide important ecological services such as biodiversity, climate regulation, and cultural benefits through recreation and tourism. However, many of the world's reefs are declining, with Caribbean reefs suffering a significant decline in living corals over the past half century. This situation emphasizes the need to assess and monitor reef conditions using a variety of methods. In this study, a new method for assessing reef conditions to inform management using participatory mapping by coral reef experts in the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI) is described. Occupational SCUBA divers were recruited (n=87) to map coral reef conditions, uses, and threats (stressors) using an internet-based mapping website. The data reveal an uneven geographic distribution of reef conditions in the USVI with the most frequently mapped perceived healthy reef characteristics being: large amount of physical reef structure (n=872 markers); endangered or threatened species present (n=721); and large amount of live coral cover (n=615). The greatest perceived threats were: invasive species (n=606); water pollution (n=234); and unsustainable fishing (n=200). Areas of important reef characteristics, perceived threats to reefs, and perceived recovery potential were plotted to identify areas requiring critical management attention. The authors found that perceptions of healthy reef conditions outnumbered perceptions of reef threats for nine of the ten most familiar coral reefs; the most frequent activity type within the coral reefs was tourism diving; and for the most familiar coral reefs, the divers perceived a high recovery potential. Given the novelty of participatory mapping methods to assess coral reefs, the strengths and weaknesses of the method is evaluated. The authors further propose a management typology for categorizing reef areas to inform their future management. In the absence of primary data, or, as a supplement to underwater surveys and remotely-sensed data on reef condition, participatory mapping can provide a cost-effective means for assessing coral reef conditions while identifying place-specific reef locations requiring management attention.

"Increase in power demand has required providing infrastructure, such as huge power plants and transmission lines. However, the recent trends in power system planning and operation are being toward maximum utilization of existing electricity infrastructure with tight operating margins because of new constraints placed by economic, political, and environmental issues. This might cause serious stability problems when a severe fault or a sudden outage of critical lines occurs. Therefore, the special protection scheme (SPS) has been used by generator tripping and successive load shedding to prevent a large-scale blackout by the cascading effect. If the number of tripping generators in the SPS operation is reduced, the enormous cost of power outage can be saved. This paper analyzes the enhancement of SPS via the transient stability improvement by the static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) applied to a generation side of Korea electric power system. First, its characteristic related to the SPS is described. Then, the proper capacity of STATCOM is determined with the equal area criterion to reduce the number of tripping generators. Also, the new control method for STATCOM is proposed for its full utilization. Finally, its effectiveness is verified by the case study with the practical data of Korea electric power system.

"Effective interpersonal communication depends on the ability to perceive and interpret nonverbal emotional expressions from multiple sensory modalities. Current theoretical models propose that visual and auditory emotion perception involves a network of brain regions including the primary sensory cortices, the superior temporal sulcus (STS), and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). However, relatively little is known about how the dynamic interplay between these regions gives rise to the perception of emotions. In recent years, there has been increasing recognition of the importance of neural oscillations in mediating neural communication within and between functional neural networks. Here we review studies investigating changes in oscillatory activity during the perception of visual, auditory, and audiovisual emotional expressions, and aim to characterize the functional role of neural oscillations in nonverbal emotion perception. Findings from the reviewed literature suggest that theta band oscillations most consistently differentiate between emotional and neutral expressions. While early theta synchronization appears to reflect the initial encoding of emotionally salient sensory information, later fronto-central theta synchronization may reflect the further integration of sensory information with internal representations. Additionally, gamma synchronization reflects facilitated sensory binding of emotional expressions within regions such as the OFC. STS, and, potentially, the amygdala. However, the evidence is more ambiguous when it comes to the role of oscillations within the alpha and beta frequencies, which vary as a function of modality (or modalities), presence or absence of predictive information, and attentional or task demands. Thus, the synchronization of neural oscillations within specific frequency bands mediates the rapid detection, integration, and evaluation of emotional expressions. Moreover, the functional coupling of oscillatory activity across multiples frequency bands supports a predictive coding model of multisensory emotion perception in which emotional facial and body expressions facilitate the processing of emotional vocalizations.

"Today, the development of information and communications technologies have changed the utility landscape dramatically. In particular, electricity distribution networks rely heavily on a multitude of intelligent systems and devices that communicate among each other in much more advanced ways than in the past. As the Smart Grid is becoming nowadays a critical component in the electricity delivery system, it is important to make sure the grid is equipped with adequate security mechanisms that are able to guarantee its reliable operation and real-time information exchange within the power infrastructure. Therefore, in this paper we analyze critical cybersecurity aspects associated with smart grid services, including previous cyber-attack cases on smart grids, potential vulnerabilities/threats, and advanced cybersecurity strategies for smart grids with technical and management measures. Ultimately, while the service providers should continuously enhance the traditional security measures such as authentication, access control, authorization, data encryption, public key infrastructure (PKI), firewalls, log analysis, intrusion detection systems, and network security protocols, we propose that the advanced technical measures should 1) make smart grids survivable even under cyber attacks and internal failures; 2) employ a defense-in-depth approach; 3) employ a defense-in-depth approach; and 4) provide more scalable security measures. Furthermore, we also propose that the advanced management measures should 1) establish a cybersecurity governance strategy; 2) develop a strong incident response plan; 3) cultivate a culture of security; 4) employ a public-private partnership approach; and 5) comply with widely recognized security standards.

"A poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) nanocom-posite incorporated with polydopamine-coated reduced graphene oxide (rGO@PDOPA) nanosheets has been developed with high dielectric permittivity and low loss for electricity storage applications. Structural analysis indicates that PDOPA was successfully anchored onto rGOs through non-covalent linkage under mild conditions. The presence of PDOPA layer between rGO and PVDF can not only prevent the agglomeration and direct contact of original rGOs but also enhance the interaction between PVDF and rGO and microcapacitor formation. Compared to rGO/PVDF composites, higher dielectric permittivity and lower loss factor were achieved simultaneously in rGO@PDOPA/PVDF nanocomposites at low and moderate frequencies. The PDOPA interface layers are effective in modifying the dielectric characteristics of the composites to increase the dielectric permittivity without the introduction of loss mechanisms. This study demonstrates that PDOPA is an ideal interface layer for the development of new percolative dielectric composites with high dielectric permittivity and low loss.

"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide a flexible and low-cost solution for the acquisition of high-resolution data. The potential of high-resolution UAV imagery to create and update cadastral maps is being increasingly investigated. Existing procedures generally involve substantial fieldwork and many manual processes. Arguably, multiple parts of UAV-based cadastral mapping workflows could be automated. Specifically, as many cadastral boundaries coincide with visible boundaries, they could be extracted automatically using image analysis methods. This study investigates the transferability of gPb contour detection, a state-of-the-art computer vision method, to remotely sensed UAV images and UAV-based cadastral mapping. Results show that the approach is transferable to UAV data and automated cadastral mapping: object contours are comprehensively detected at completeness and correctness rates of up to 80%. The detection quality is optimal when the entire scene is covered with one orthoimage, due to the global optimization of gPb contour detection. However, a balance between high completeness and correctness is hard to achieve, so a combination with area-based segmentation and further object knowledge is proposed. The localization quality exhibits the usual dependency on ground resolution. The approach has the potential to accelerate the process of general boundary delineation during the creation and updating of cadastral maps.

"Purpose of review The microbiome continues to demonstrate an important role in immune and metabolic programming. This review will focus on the mechanistic implications of recent findings for diabetes pathogenesis and treatment. Recent findings Multiple techniques are developing to specify the microbiome. At the same time, new insights have emerged into local interactions of microbial products with human development. New findings demonstrate that key bacteria and their products result in the programming of diabetes-modulating Th17 and regulatory T lymphocytes within and outside the intestine. The role of the bacterial metagenome in programming human metabolism has also revealed new insights. In turn, these findings suggest a framework in which the microbiome may be modified to change the course of diabetes. Summary The microbiome is a key regulator of metabolism and immunity. Specific bacteria and their secreted products are now known to program Th17 and regulatory T-cell development, which may change the course of diabetes. Bacterial genomics are demonstrating important, modifiable roles of bacterial gene products in metabolism. Further understanding of this symbiotic relationship will provide new avenues for intervention in diabetes.

"This paper deals with the characterization and construction of a rotating brushless PM exciter intended for synchronous generator excitation purposes. Traditionally, PM exciters are used as pre-exciters in synchronous generator excitations systems. In order to reduce the number of components and to increase the step time response of the system, a PM exciter is designed as an outer pole PM machine, with permanent magnets on the stator and armature windings on the rotor. The exciter was constructed electrically and mechanically to be fitted into an in-house synchronous generator test setup. A finite element model of the exciter was validated with no-load measurements of voltages and magnetic flux densities. The exciter was then characterized with unsaturated and saturated parameters.

"Systematic identification and characterization of genetic perturbations have proven useful to decipher gene function and cellular pathways. However, the conventional approaches of permanent gene deletion cannot be applied to essential genes. We have pioneered a unique collection of similar to 70 temperature-sensitive (ts) lethal mutants for studying cell cycle regulation in the unicellular green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii(1). These mutations identify essential genes, and the ts alleles can be conditionally inactivated by temperature shift, providing valuable tools to identify and analyze essential functions. Mutant collections are much more valuable if they are close to comprehensive, since scattershot collections can miss important components. However, this requires the efficient collection of a large number of mutants, especially in a wide-target screen. Here, we describe a robotics-based pipeline for generating ts lethal mutants and analyzing their phenotype in Chlamydomonas. This technique can be applied to any microorganism that grows on agar. We have collected over 3000 ts mutants, probably including mutations in most or all cell-essential pathways, including about 200 new candidate cell cycle mutations. Subsequent molecular and cellular characterization of these mutants should provide new insights in plant cell biology; a comprehensive mutant collection is an essential prerequisite to ensure coverage of a broad range of biological pathways. These methods are integrated with downstream genetics and bioinformatics procedures for efficient mapping and identification of the causative mutations that are beyond the scope of this manuscript.

In this paper, a comprehensive analysis of interface behaviour at the Inclined Plane device is presented for a non-woven geotextile on a geomembrane in dry condition. New test procedure are proposed, and the related parameters of friction are defined in order to properly characterise friction behaviour. For the Inclined Plane, the shear strength of a geosynthetic interface cannot be characterised by a single parameter, as the interface behaviour is sensitive to the different kinematic conditions. To this purpose, a comparison is shown with the results of complementary tests carried out using the Shaking Table test. For both test procedures, particular attention was paid to the influence of the relative sliding velocity. Finally, the sensitivity of the interface to mechanical damage caused by large relative displacements was quantified. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"Clinical and animal model studies have implicated inflammation and peripheral immune cell responses in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Peripheral immune cells including T cells circulate in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of healthy adults and are found in the brains of AD patients and AD rodent models. Blocking entry of peripheral macrophages into the CNS was reported to increase amyloid burden in an AD mouse model. To assess inflammation in the 5xFAD (Tg) mouse model, we first quantified central and immune cell profiles in the deep cervical lymph nodes and spleen. In the brains of Tg mice, activated (MHCII+, CD45(high), and Ly6C(high)) myeloid-derived CD11b(+) immune cells are decreased while CD3(+) T cells are increased as a function of age relative to non-Tg mice. These immunological changes along with evidence of increased mRNA levels for several cytokines suggest that immune regulation and trafficking patterns are altered in Tg mice. Levels of soluble Tumor Necrosis Factor (sTNF) modulate blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and are increased in CSF and brain parenchyma post-mortem in AD subjects and Tg mice. We report here that in vivo peripheral administration of XPro1595, a novel biologic that sequesters sTNF into inactive heterotrimers, reduced the age-dependent increase in activated immune cells in Tg mice, while decreasing the overall number of CD4(+) T cells. In addition, XPro1595 treatment in vivo rescued impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) measured in brain slices in association with decreased Ala plaques in the subiculum. Selective targeting of sTNF may modulate brain immune cell infiltration, and prevent or delay neuronal dysfunction in AD. Significance statement: Immune cells and cytokines perform specialized functions inside and outside the brain to maintain optimal brain health; but the extent to which their activities change in response to neuronal dysfunction and degeneration is not well understood. Our findings indicate that neutralization of sTNF reduced the age dependent increase in activated immune cells in Tg mice, while decreasing the overall number of CD4+ T cells. In addition, impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) was rescued by XPro1595 in association with decreased hippocampal Ala plaques. Selective targeting of sTNF holds translational potential to modulate brain immune cell infiltration, dampen neuroinflammation, and prevent or delay neuronal dysfunction in AD. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

"The paper presents a methodology of optimization of the gating system for sand casting using the genetic algorithm. Software package for computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) was used as the support to the design and verification of the optimized gating system. The geometry of the gating system of sand casting in excavator tooth holder was the subject of optimization. The objective was to maximize filling rate given the constraints posed by both the ingate module and Reynolds number. Mold filling time has been presented as a function of the ingate cross section and casting height. Given the conditions above, as the result of the optimization, a complete geometry of the gating system has been defined. Numerical simulation (software MAGMA 5) has been used to verify the validity of the optimized geometry of the gating system.

"This paper presents a new stochastic operation scheduling model for microgrid in day-ahead electricity market considering the forecast uncertainties of wind generations, microgrid's load, and locational marginal price of the point of common coupling, as well as the uncertainties pertaining to availability of generation units of the microgrid. The financial risk caused by these uncertainties is modeled by conditional value-at-risk criterion. The proposed approach is formulated as a risk-minimizing two-stage stochastic model based on mixed-integer linear programming framework. This model minimizes the expected scheduling cost together with the cost of financial risk. The impacts of different uncertainty sources on the model's results in both grid-connected and islanded operation modes are extensively studied. Additionally, higher effectiveness of the proposed stochastic model compared with common deterministic approach, regarding total operation cost and convergence behavior, is illustrated through an out-of-sample analysis.

"Biological specimens such as cells, tissues and biofluids (urine, blood) contain mixtures of many different biomolecules, all of which contribute to a Raman spectrum at any given point. The separation and identification of pure biochemical components remains one of the biggest challenges in Raman spectroscopy. Multivariate curve resolution, a matrix factorization method, is a powerful, yet flexible, method that can be used with constraints, such as non-negativity, to decompose a complex spectroscopic data matrix into a small number of physically meaningful pure spectral components along with their relative abundances. This paper reviews recent applications of multivariate curve resolution by alternating least squares analysis to Raman spectroscopic and imaging data obtained either in vivo or in vitro from biological and medical samples.

"Magnetic properties of silicon steel laminations are important features in power transformer and electrical machine design and manufacture. Conventional testing methods such as Epstein Frame and Single Sheet Tester may only consider one direction or one sheet, which may deviate from the real application, particularly in core loss calculation. A 3-D magnetic properties' testing method is proposed in this paper. By using the designed special surface B-H sensing coils, the dynamic magnetic hysteresis properties of a laminated non-grain-oriented silicon steel sample are accurately measured. The relationship between B and H in alternating, 2-D rotational, and 3-D spherical rotational excitations, from 50 to 200 Hz, is studied and analyzed. In order to control the B waveform better, the harmonics of Bx and By signals are analyzed at 50 Hz. The alternating core losses in the rolling, transverse, and laminated directions and the rotational core losses in the xoy plane of this sample at 50, 100, and 200 Hz are calculated and analyzed. Moreover, the core losses in the three directions are well predicted by means of total core loss separation theory.

"This paper describes an experimental investigation of the load-settlement behaviour of a model strip footing resting on a reinforced homogeneous sand bed for several embedment depths at medium-dense to very dense states of sand. The reinforcement is a single-layer woven geotextile layer without and with wraparound ends at a depth of 0.3B from the base of the footing of width B. A particular focus of this study is the effect of wraparound ends of the reinforcement on the load-bearing capacity. The experimental results of the study are compared with numerical findings from a finite-element analysis carried out using the Plaxis 2D software. The study shows there is a significant improvement in both the load-bearing capacity and the stiffness of the sand bed with increasing footing embedment depth as well as with the provision of wraparound ends of the reinforcement. The numerical results follow the experimental results closely for the lower settlement values. The results presented in graphical form in this paper can be used as general guidelines for practical conditions similar to those considered in the present study.

"The aim of this study was to examine differences in the neural processing of social information about kin and friends at different levels of closeness and social network level. Twenty-five female participants engaged in a cognitive social task involving different individuals in their social network while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning to detect BOLD (Blood Oxygen Level Dependent) signals changes. Greater levels of activation occurred in several regions of the brain previously associated with social cognition when thinking about friends than when thinking about kin, including the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC). Linear parametric analyses across network layers further showed that, when it came to thinking about friends, activation increased in the vMPFC, lingual gyrus, and sensorimotor cortex as individuals thought about friends at closer layers of the network. These findings suggest that maintaining friendships may be more cognitively exacting than maintaining kin relationships.

"Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS), Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS) and chronic infantile neurological, cutaneous and articular syndrome/neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease (CINCA/NOMID) were originally described as three distinct diseases. After the identification of their common genetic origin in 2001 and 2002, they are now perceived as a continuum of one disease entity and labelled cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS). Mutations in the NLRP3 gene on chromosome 1q44 can be detected in many affected patients. These lead to the synthesis of an altered gene product named cryopyrin. This is part of the NLRP3 inflammasome and causes the activation of caspase 1 and an excess production of IL-1 beta, which is the driving force behind the inflammatory reactions observed in CAPS patients. In symptomatic patients, confirmation of a mutation using traditional methods of genetic analysis may not always be successful (up to 40% in the case of CINCA/NOMID phenotypes); however, in many cases somatic mutations can be found using modern methods, such as next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. In contrast, low-penetrance NLRP3 variants may also be identified in healthy family members and are present in low frequencies in the general population. Some of the mutation carriers nevertheless present with typical signs of autoinflammation; however, their phenotype is different compared to the classical CAPS presentation. These patients display unspecific systemic inflammatory signs more frequently but show an organ involvement less often. While the detection of NLRP3 gene mutations may be viewed as confirmatory, CAPS is still predominantly a clinical diagnosis; therefore, recently published diagnostic criteria do not require the demonstration of a mutation.

"A new compact scheme has been developed for any non-uniform grid. The compact scheme has been developed for spatial discretization and is analyzed here in conjunction with four-stage, fourth order Runge-Kutta (RK4) scheme for time integration while solving the one-dimensional convection equation. The space-time discretization combination is calibrated by subjecting the system to global spectral analysis (GSA) which was developed by the authors' group. Here, the compact scheme has been obtained by using a combination of two bi-diagonal schemes. The novel aspect of this scheme is its application in the physical plane directly without the necessity of mapping or transformations. Some typical cases for problems in acoustics, as well as fluid mechanics, have been studied here and potential use in large eddy simulations (LES) has been demonstrated by solving Navier-Stokes equation for lid driven cavity.

"Low-power is one of the key driving forces in modern very large scale integration systems. Recent studies show that 3-D integrated circuits (ICs) offer a significant power saving over 2-D ICs. However, these studies are mainly limited to two-tier (2-tier) designs. Thus, in this paper, we extend our target to three-tier (3-tier) 3-D ICs. This paper first shows that the one additional tier available in 3-tier 3-D ICs does offer more power saving compared with their 2-tier 3-D IC counterparts, but more careful floorplanning, through-silicon via management, and block folding considerations are required. Second, we find that the 3-tiers can be bonded in several different ways: 1) face-to-back only; 2) face-to-face and face-to-back combined; and 3) back-to-back and face-to-face combined. This paper shows that these choices pose additional challenges in design optimizations for more power saving. Lastly, we develop effective computer-aided-design solutions that are seamlessly integrated into commercial 2-D IC tools to handle 3-tier 3-D IC power optimization under various bonding style options. With our low-power design methods combined, our 3-tier 3-D ICs provide -14.8% more power reduction over 2-tier 3-D ICs, and -36.0% over 2-D ICs in microprocessor cores under the same performance. In full-chip microprocessors, our 3-tier 3-D ICs provide -27.2% more power reduction over 2-D ICs.

"Introduction: Since drinking water can be a vehicle for the transmission of pathogens, the detection of enteric viruses in these water samples is essential to establish the appropriate measures to control and prevent associated diseases. Objective: To analyze the results obtained for enteric viruses in water samples for human consumption received at the Colombian Instituto Nacional de Salud and establish their association with the data on water quality in Colombian municipalities. Materials and methods: We conducted a descriptive-retrospective analysis of the results obtained in the detection of rotavirus, enterovirus, hepatitis A virus and adenovirus in water samples received for complementary studies of enteric hepatitis, acute diarrheal disease and foodborne diseases. Data were correlated with the results of water quality surveillance determined by the national human consumption water quality index (IRCA). Results: Of the 288 samples processed from 102 Colombian municipalities, 50.7% were positive for viruses: 26.73% for hepatitis A virus, 20.48% for enterovirus and rotavirus and 18.05% for adenovirus. Viruses were detected in 48.26% of non-treated water samples and in 45.83% of treated water samples. The IRCA index showed no correlation with the presence of viruses. Conclusions: The presence of viruses in water represents a public health risk and, therefore, the prevention of virus transmission through water requires appropriate policies to reinforce water supply systems and improve epidemiological surveillance.

"The critical involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in both physiological and pathological processes in cell biology makes their detection and assessment a fundamental topic in biomedical research. Established methodologies to study ROS in cell biology take advantage of oxidation reactions between the ROS and a reduced probe. After reacting the probe reveals the presence of ROS either by the appearance of colour (chromogenic reaction) or fluorescence (fluorogenic reaction). However current methodologies rarely allow for a site-specific detection of ROS production. Here we propose a colorimetric reaction driven by the oxidation of 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) by photodynamically-produced ROS that allows for fine detection of the ROS production site. The introduced methodology is fast, easy to implement and permits cellular resolution at the submicrometric level. Although the basic protocol is proved in a photodynamic model of ROS generation, the principle is applicable to many different scenarios of intracellular ROS production. As a consequence this proposed methodology should greatly complement other techniques aiming at establishing a precise subcellular localization of ROS generation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Many efforts have been devoted to modeling the diffusive impedance of conjugated polymer (CP) based actuators using their equivalent electrical circuits. Employing the same methodology, CP based mechanical sensors can also be treated by an equivalent transmission line circuit and their overall impedance can be modeled, correspondingly. Due to the large number of resources to study the electrical circuits, this technique is a practical tool. Therefore, in this study, an equivalent RC-circuit model including electrochemical parameters is determined to obtain a better perception of the sensing mechanism of these mechanical sensors. Conjugated polymers are capable of generating an output current or voltage upon an induced mechanical deformation or force. This observed behavior in polymer based mechanical sensors is considered as the reverse actuation process. Many outstanding properties of the conjugated polymer actuators including their light weight and biocompatibility are still retained by these sensors. Sensors with a trilayer configuration are capable of operating in air in response to a mechanically induced bending deformation. However, due to their nonlinear behavior and multivariable characteristics, it is required to propose a systematic approach in order to optimize their performance and gain the optimal values of their constituent decision variable. Therefore, the proposed mathematical model is used to define the output voltage of the PPy based mechanical sensor along with the sensitivity of the model to the applied frequency of the induced deformation. Applying a multiobjective optimization algorithm, the optimization problem was solved and the tracking ability of the proposed model was then verified.

"One-component materials with unidirectional fibrous structure are a new class of structural materials that are mechanically similar to biological ones. These contain channel cracks (CC) and weak interfaces in the structure, which are the result of production technologies. Effect of the CC size and the shear strength of contacts between fibers were investigated in the three-dimensional analysis of the elastic and inelastic shear extensions at the interface of the cracked fiber in the bundle of undamaged fibers under tension. The fiber stacking in the bundle is hexagonal. The fiber cross-sections are regular hexagons. It is found that the energy dissipation at the interface of the cracked fiber, the stress intensity factor and the crack opening displacement for the crack in the fiber and the length of the interface with the non-zero shear stresses are determined by the product of the contact cohesive shear strength and the contact width. At the optimal cohesive shear strength of the interfaces, the channel cracks shall not prejudice to the basic strength characteristics of the material.

"Cytochrome P450 (CYP) is a super family of mixed-function oxidases that are responsible for the human metabolism of drugs and endogenous compounds, as well as environmental and dietary substances. Many CYP enzymes function in the liver, but presence of CYP2E1 in the brain is demonstrating its role in both nicotine and ethanol metabolism. To examine the association between CYP2E1 polymorphism and the risk of oral cancer, we performed a case-control study on a south Indian population. 157 patients with oral cancer and 132 age and sexmatched controls were recruited. Three SNPs of the CYP2E1 gene [4768G>A (p. V179I, dbSNP rs6413419), CYP2E1_-1295G>C (dbSNP rs3813867) and CYP2E1_-1055C>T (dbSNP rs2031920)] were genotyped using TaqMan allelic discrimination. The V179I locus is monomorphic in the study subjects, whereas rs3813867 and rs2031920 are co-inherited with a minor allele frequency of 0.022. None of the polymorphic sites deviated from HWE in controls. A much lesser frequency of the uncommon c2 allele was seen in our control subjects than in Caucasians and East Asians. There were no significant differences between oral cancer and controls in the distribution of either allelic or genotype frequencies. None of the haplotypes showed a significant association with oral cancer. Our results suggest that CYP2E1 is not a major or independent determinant in the pathogenesis of oral cancer in south Indians.

"Background: The role of environmental exposures in the pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) remains unclear. In particular, two types of exposures have been suspected to play a role: mechanical stress and infections. The objective of this case-control study was to determine if childhood infections are associated with later development of AS. Methods: The cases with AS were identified through the Swedish national outpatient specialised-care register, based on having been given at least one AS diagnosis in the register between 2001 and 2010. Five controls per case were identified in the Swedish population register, matched at the time-point of the index case's first spondyloarthritis diagnosis on sex, birth year, and county. All cases/controls matched prior to the age of 17 years were excluded, as well as all cases/controls given a diagnosis of reactive arthritis or juvenile arthritis at any time point, or any other diagnosis of a rheumatic disease, psoriasis, iridocyclitis, or inflammatory bowel disease before the time-point of matching. All events of hospitalisation with an infection before the age of 17 years were retrieved from the register, and categorised according to the focus of the infection. Odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (CIs) were determined through conditional logistic regression analyses. Results: Of the 2453 cases with AS and 10,257 controls, 17.4 % of the cases and 16.3 % of the controls had been hospitalised with an infection before the age of 17 years (OR 1.08, 95 % CI 0.96-1.22). Appendicitis (1.5 % cases; 2.5 % controls; OR 0.59, 95 % CI 0.41-0.83), respiratory tract infections (cases 11.2 %; controls 9.2 %; OR 1.24, 95 % CI 1.07-1.44) and, in particular, tonsillitis (cases 3.7 %; controls 2.8 %; OR 1.31, 95 % CI 1.03-1.67) were associated with AS. There were no associations between AS and any other type of infection, and the point estimates were similar in several sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Childhood appendicitis was associated with a decreased risk, whereas respiratory tract infections were associated with an increased risk for later development of AS. These findings support a possible relationship between childhood infections and later development of AS, although the study is limited to infections resulting in inpatient care.

"Introduction: Neuroinflammation is a crucial mechanism in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases pathophysiology. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) YKL-40 - an indicator of microglial activation - has recently been identified by proteomic studies as a candidate biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD).Areas covered: We review the impact of CSF YKL-40 as a pathophysiological biomarker for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. CSF YKL-40 concentrations have been shown to predict progression from prodromal mild cognitive impairment to AD dementia. Moreover, a positive association between CSF YKL-40 and other biomarkers of neurodegeneration - particularly total tau protein - has been reported during the asymptomatic preclinical stage of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Albeit preliminary, current data do not support an association between APOE-epsilon 4 status and CSF YKL-40 concentrations. When interpreting the diagnostic/prognostic significance of CSF YKL-40 concentrations in neurodegenerative diseases, potential confounders - including age, metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors, diagnostic criteria for selecting cases/controls - need to be considered.Expert opinion/commentary: CSF YKL-40 represents a pathophysiological biomarker reflecting immune/inflammatory mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases, associated with tau protein pathology. Besides being associated with tau pathology, CSF YKL-40 adds to the growing array of biomarkers reflecting distinct molecular brain mechanisms potentially useful for stratifying individuals for biomarker-guided, targeted anti-inflammatory therapies emerging from precision medicine.

"Boredom is typically regarded a nuisance. Past research on boredom depicts this common emotion as a correlate of many detrimental psychological and social factors, including addiction, depression, discrimination, and aggression. We present a more nuanced perspective on boredom. Specifically, we propose and test that state boredom serves an important self-regulatory function with the potential to foster positive interpersonal consequences: It signals a lack of purpose in activity and fosters a search for meaningful engagement. We examined whether boredom can subsequently cause prosocial intentions if the corresponding prosocial behavior is seen as purposeful. As predicted, boredom, which is characterized by a search for meaning (pilot study), promoted prosocial intentions (Experiment 1), in particular when the corresponding behavior was seen as highly meaningful (Experiment 2). Our novel findings suggest that boredom can have desirable consequences and recasts this emotion as not merely good or bad but rather as personally and socially functional.

"In this paper, a class of large deployable mechanisms constructed by plane-symmetric Bricard linkages is presented. The plane-symmetric Bricard linkage is a closed-loop overconstrained spatial mechanism composed of six hinge-jointed bars, which has one plane of symmetry during its deployment process. The kinematic analysis of the linkage is presented from the perspectives of geometric conditions, closure equations, and degree-of-freedom. The results illustrate that the linkage has one degree-of-freedom and can be deployed from the folded configuration to one rectangle plane. Therefore, the plane-symmetric Bricard linkage can be used as a basic deployable unit to construct larger deployable mechanisms. Four plane-symmetric Bricard linkages can be assembled into a quadrangular module by sharing the vertical bars of the adjacent units. The module is a multiloop deployable mechanism and has one degree-of-freedom. The singularity analysis of the module is developed, and two methods to avoid singularity are presented. A large deployable mast, deployable plane truss, and deployable ring are built with several plane-symmetric Bricard linkages. The deployment properties of the large deployable mechanisms are analyzed, and computer-aided design models for typical examples are built to illustrate their feasibility and validate the analysis and design methods.

"Dynamic projection mapping for moving objects has attracted much attention in recent years. However, conventional approaches have faced some issues, such as the target objects being limited to rigid objects, and the limited moving speed of the targets. In this paper, we focus on dynamic projection mapping onto rapidly deforming non-rigid surfaces with a speed sufficiently high that a human does not perceive any misalignment between the target object and the projected images. In order to achieve such projection mapping, we need a high-speed technique for tracking non-rigid surfaces, which is still a challenging problem in the field of computer vision. We propose the Deformable Dot Cluster Marker (DDCM), a novel fiducial marker for high-speed tracking of non-rigid surfaces using a high-frame-rate camera. The DDCM has three performance advantages. First, it can be detected even when it is strongly deformed. Second, it realizes robust tracking even in the presence of external and self occlusions. Third, it allows millisecond-order computational speed. Using DDCM and a high-speed projector, we realized dynamic projection mapping onto a deformed sheet of paper and a T-shirt with a speed sufficiently high that the projected images appeared to be printed on the objects.

"Prostate cancer (PCa) has become the second leading cause of male cancer-related mortality in the United States. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are able to migrate to tumor tissues, and are thus considered to be novel antitumor carriers. However, due to their immunosuppressive nature, the application of MSCs in PCa therapy remains limited. In this study, we investigated the effect of MSCs overexpressing an NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin 1 (MSCs-Sirt1) on prostate tumor growth, and we analyzed the underlying mechanisms. Our results show that MSCs accelerate prostate tumor growth, whereas MSCs-Sirt1 significantly suppresses tumor growth. Natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages are the prominent antitumor effectors of the MSCs-Sirt1-induced antitumor activity. IFN-gamma and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) are highly expressed in MSCs-Sirt1 mice. The antitumor effect of MSCs-Sirt1 is weakened when CXCL10 and IFN-gamma are inhibited. These results show that MSCs-Sirt1 can effectively inhibit prostate cancer growth recruiting NK cells and macrophages in a tumor inflammatory microenvironment.

The four sections had similar embankment loadings but different improvement options (one unimproved, one with pile-support only, one with a single layer geotextile-reinforced platform and pile-support, and one with two layers of geogrid-reinforced platform and pile-support). Like the field data, the numerical results show that the inclusion of piles decreases the settlement at the subsoil surface to 52% of that for the unimproved section, and the addition of a single layer of geotextile reinforcement (J = 800 kN/m) further reduced settlement to only 31% of that of the unimproved section. The effects of geosynthetic reinforcement and multiple layers of reinforcement on the performance of the pile-supported embankment are discussed. The relative load transfer is calculated using eight existing methods and they are compared with the field measurements and numerical results.

"Predicting the behavior of geotextiles made of polyesters and polypropylene fibers is described by differential equations derived from mechanical models. Thereby, we describe the behavior of geotextiles up to the elastic limit. The elastic limit represents the permissible load which the geotextile material may be subjected to during exploitation, and without distorting its structure. The elastic limit is defined by analyzing the stress-strain curve of analyzed geotextiles. Nonwoven geotextile materials of polyester and polypropylene fibers with surface mass of 150, 200, 250, 300 and 500g/m(2) were used as experimental material.

"Water pollution is one of the most pervasive problems afflicting people all over the world, while adsorption is the most impactful method to remove the organic pollutants from water. To demonstrate this, a facile and efficient approach is extendable to prepare porous polyurea monolith as a new type of adsorbent for water purification in our research. In order to obtain the porous polyurea monolith, the reaction only between TDI monomer and vapor by using the centrifugally spinning moulding is prepared. Notably, the results show that centrifugally spinning moulding is an effective method to form the whole block structure. According to the specific surface area, pore size and pore size distribution of porous polyurea monolith are affected at different centrifugal speeds. The porous polyurea monolith has continuous interconnected fiber-like clusters skeletal structure, which is composed of mesopores and maropores. Moreover, the porous polyurea monolith could adsorb oils and organic solvents from water fast, which can be attribute to its highly hydrophobic and oleophilic properties. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"Nowadays, distributed denial of service (DDoS) becomes a major challenge in the network as it affects the network at multi-level. This leads to traffic overhead and wastage of bandwidth utilisation. In order to overcome these issues, ant-based DDoS detection technique using roaming virtual honeypots is proposed. In this technique, virtual roaming honeypot along with the multi-level secure architecture is used to collect the information about the various intruders at different levels in the network. Ant colony optimisation technique is used to detect the intruders based on the pheromone deposit on that considered area. A multi-level IP log table is used to detect the intruders at different levels of the network. Once the affected area is found, the information is sent to multi-level architecture to limit the spread of the affected area to the honeypot. This information is sent to the honeypot to make a defence system against the attackers. The advantage of the proposed technique is that it provides a full defence against DDoS at multi-level without creating any traffic overhead.

"This paper introduces a new electric machine for Front-End Accessory Drive (FEAD) of Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs). The novelty of the electric machine lies in its ability to perform multitasking. Besides the independent motor or independent generator operation like any other electric machine, the proposed machine is able to run as motor and generator simultaneously. A dual winding electric machine forms the core part of the proposed system. Windings of the electric machine are concentrated type so that electrical and magnetic isolation is maintained. This allows simultaneous motoring and generating operation in the single housing of electric machine. Design considerations of the proposed electric machine have been outlined in the paper. Comparison between proposed and conventional approaches has been made to highlight potential benefits of the new approach. Thermal analyses have been performed to show the suitability and limits of the multitasked electric machine in the HEV applications. Overall performance of the proposed machine is presented by experimental results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"Compacted clay liners are vulnerable to desiccation cracking if exposed to atmospheric conditions for extended periods of time. Three clayey soils typically used as landfill liners were studied in relatively large-scale containers exposed to real atmospheric conditions for a full annual cycle. Desiccation cracking and particularly the variation in depth of cracks were examined in soil pairs; one set was directly exposed to atmospheric conditions and the other covered with a white separator geotextile. Cracks started to grow deeper in time with some variations with rainfall events up to a few months followed by no significant increase later. Smaller crack depths were observed for the soil with the lowest plasticity index. Using a geotextile cover resulted in 35-79% reduction in average crack depth. Hydraulic conductivity of the soils increased at the end of the experiment with greater increase for soils with deeper cracks. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

"We test an information theory of prosocial behavior whereby ego utility and self-signaling crowd out the effect of consumption utility on choice. The data come from two field experiments involving purchases of a consumer good bundled with a charitable donation. Across experimental cells, we randomize the price level and the donation level. A model-free analysis of the data reveals nonmonotonic regions of demand when the good is bundled with relatively large charitable donations. Subjects also self-report lower ratings of feeling good about themselves when offered bundles with large donations and price discounts. The evidence suggests that price discounts crowd out consumer self-inference of altruism. Alternative motivation-crowding theories are rejected due to their inability to explain the nonmonotonic data moments. The standard use of interaction effects and other falsification checks to explore the underlying choice mechanism in an experimental setting is complicated in our self-signaling context. Instead, a novel feature of our analysis consists of using the experimental data to estimate the structural form of a model of consumer demand with self-signaling. We specify a model in which consumers obtain both consumption and ego utility from their choices. Ego utility derives from a consumer's posterior self-beliefs after making her choice. An estimator is proposed that handles the potential multiplicity of equilibria that can arise in the self-signaling model. The model estimates allowus to quantify the economic role of ego utility and to explore the underlying signaling mechanism. Nested tests reject the hypothesis of no self-signaling. Alternative model specifications that potentially allow for nonmontonic demand without the self-signaling structure exhibit an inferior fit to the data. The model estimates imply that consumer response to the donations are mainly driven by ego utility and not by consumption utility (i.e., not by altruistic motives). The findings from the combination of a field experiment and a structural model contribute to a growing literature on self-signaling and consumer behavior by quantifying the magnitude of self-signaling on preferences and choices. The results also have implications for the design of a cause marketing campaign and the potential negative synergies between price and nonprice promotions.

"Warp-knitted brushed fabrics are special pile fabrics with uneven and declining piles that consist of broken filament ends. It is difficult to predict the finial pattern of the pile surface in the process of the design of patterned fabric. There are few researches on computer simulation of the fabric because of their complicated and fuzzy characteristic. This paper focuses on computer simulation of this group of pile fabrics. Firstly, the characteristics of warp-knitted brushed fabric and the factors that influence the pile are discussed. Secondly, a simplified line model is proposed to represent the shape of the pile by some lines in a certain titling angle, radial angle and length. A two-dimensional matrix is used to describe the position and color of piles in one pattern repeat. Finally, based on the mathematic model, a program is developed by VC++.NET to realize the simulation of the brushed fabric with a patterned pile. By the input of some parameters that were adjusted according to the craft, the two-dimensional computer simulation of the pile surface was found to be similar to the actual patterned pile fabric. It is proved that the method is feasible and contributes to the development of a computer-aided design system to realize the design and simulation of the warp-knitted brushed fabric.

"Rainwater harvesting might help to achieve self-sufficiency, but it must comply with health standards. We studied the runoff quantity and quality harvested from seven urban surfaces in a university campus in Barcelona according to their use (pedestrian or motorized mobility) and materials (concrete, asphalt and slabs). An experimental rainwater harvesting system was used to collect the runoff resulting from a set of rainfall events. We estimated the runoff coefficient and initial abstraction of each surface and analyzed the physicochemical and microbiological properties, and hydrocarbon and metal content of the samples. Rainfall intensity, surface material and state of conservation were essential parameters. Because of low rainfall intensity and surface degradation, the runoff coefficient was variable, with a minimum of 0.41. Concrete had the best quality, whereas weathering and particulate matter deposition led to worse quality in asphalt areas. Physicochemical runoff quality was outstanding when compared to superficial and underground water. Microorganisms were identified in the samples (>1 CFU/100 mL) and treatment is required to meet human consumption standards. Motorized traffic mostly affects the presence of metals such as zinc (31.7 mu g/L). In the future, sustainable mobility patterns might result in improved rainwater quality standards.

"The VIIRS-DNB sensor launched in 2011 offers the remote sensing community improved capabilities for monitoring and quantifying nighttime brightness. So far, most studies of temporal changes in nighttime lights were focused on examining inter-annual trends or on sudden changes in light emission, related to demographic and economic reasons. Here, the recently released two year (2014-2015) set of monthly cloud-free VIIRS-DNB composites was used to explicitly examine seasonal changes in nighttime lights and their correspondence with seasonality of land cover in Northern and Central America. It was found that monthly changes in nighttime brightness were positively correlated with monthly changes in snow cover and in albedo, and negatively correlated with monthly changes in NDVI. These correlations were strongest in urban areas in the northeast of the USA, where high correlation coefficient values (>0.8) were obtained. Seasonality in nighttime brightness is thus an important factor to consider both when quantifying trends in light emission from annual time series, and in studies examining the adverse consequences of artificial lights on human health and on the environment.

"While learners of a second language (L2) are increasingly interacting in small groups as part of a communicative methodological paradigm, very few studies have investigated the social dynamics that occur in such groups. The aim of this study is to introduce a group work dynamic measuring instrument and to investigate the relationship between group work dynamic (GWD), or the social climate existing within a group, and learners' state-level motivational responses and amount of language produced in interactive tasks. The context for the classroom-based study was a speaking-skills course consisting of a small group of 10 Korean English learners of intermediate to high intermediate proficiency level enrolled in a Korean university TESOL certificate program. The data were based on 15 different tasks that were part of the course and two work groups for each task for a total of 30 groups. Instruments of data collection consisted of audio-video recordings, transcription of all verbal and nonverbal language produced in the tasks, the GWD measurement instrument, and post-task motivation questionnaires. Results from correlational analysis showed a significant relationship between GWD and task motivation and between GWD and language production. Nonverbal-related behaviors, furthermore, were found to be particularly influential in shaping GWD and were significantly associated with learners' task motivation, especially in the form of greater task enjoyment and sense of success. The study's findings therefore add support to socio-contextual perspectives in L2 motivation and applied linguistics that emphasize the critical role of social and group factors on motivation and language development and imply a need for educators to focus on creating positive group dynamics in their classrooms.

"This paper introduces a new multiconnponent geocomposite, the geosynthetic concrete composite mat (GCCM). Unlike traditional geosynthetic clay layer (GCL) materials that possess a bentonite clay layer as the interlayer, this GCCM has a formulated dry concrete mix impregnated in a three-dimensional geotextile fiber matrix, which hardens upon hydration to a concrete shell. This dual distinction multicomponent material is unique. This paper also provides a summary of some of the basic properties of the uncured material (before hydration), followed by an introduction to some important characteristics of the cured material. Mechanical properties are presented for both uncured and cured phases to illustrate the property transformation from the uncured to the cured state and demonstrate the contribution of both the fibrous geotextile phase and the cured concrete phase to the product properties. ASTM Committee D35 GCL test methods were applied as appropriate for this GCCM material, followed by concrete testing of the cured material. Finally, because a number of the applications for this material involve durable protection of soil from erosion under high-flow regimes, hydraulic property test results and some endurance test results are presented. The hydraulic results are from a channel testing arrangement subjecting the installed and cured material to high-velocity water flow.

"In recent work, Baez, Fong and the author introduced a framework for describing Markov processes equipped with a detailed balanced equilibrium as open systems of a certain type. These open Markov processes serve as the building blocks for more complicated processes. In this paper, we describe the potential application of this framework in the modeling of biological systems as open systems maintained away from equilibrium. We show that non-equilibrium steady states emerge in open systems of this type, even when the rates of the underlying process are such that a detailed balanced equilibrium is permitted. It is shown that these non-equilibrium steady states minimize a quadratic form which we call dissipation. In some circumstances, the dissipation is approximately equal to the rate of change of relative entropy plus a correction term. On the other hand, Prigogine's principle of minimum entropy production generally fails for non-equilibrium steady states. We use a simple model of membrane transport to illustrate these concepts.

"Objective. - To explore the clinical and allergologic characteristics of pediatric asthma, in Lambarene (Gabon). Patients and methods. - A descriptive cohort study consisted of children with wheezing respiratory disease, included consecutively from January to July 2014. Clinical evaluation, skin tests, functional capacity measurements and environmental characterization have been achieved. Results. - Seventy-three patients aged from 2 to 18 years were included. The diagnosis of asthma was retained in 58 children. Rhinitis and eczema symptom were frequent (77.6 % and 32.7 %). Clinical scores showed 3.4 % of severe persistent asthma, 5.2 % of moderate asthma, 25.8 % of mild persistent asthma and 65.5 % of intermittent asthma. The presence of domestic animals (35 %) or smokers (26 %) were uncommon. Only 15.5 % of asthmatics have sporadically received a prolonged treatment with inhaled corticosteroids. The functional tests showed 4 severe obstructive syndromes, including 3 reversible, 24 moderate obstructive syndromes, including 7 reversible. Sixty-one percent of the tested patients have positive prick test to at least one allergen. A percentage of 51.7 of asthmatic patients were sensitized to dust mites, 26 % to cockroaches, 13.8 % to dog, 13,8 % to grasses, 13.8 % to peanuts, and 6 % to Alternaria. House dust samples have revealed small amounts of dermatophagoides. Conclusion. - Asthma is a medical condition affecting the pediatric population in semi-rural areas in Gabon, the number of severe asthma is however low. In two thirds of cases, sensitization to allergens from the home environment are observed. This should lead to better overall care, including optimization of allergen avoidance, drug therapy and development of therapeutic patient education. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

"We present EasyHouse, a system developed to allow people with disabilities and their family members to control their home environment (e.g., turn on/off a light, turn on/off the TV) using a smartphone. The user interface was designed to be adjustable to the needs of each user. The development of EasyHouse followed an iterative user-centered design approach. A paper-based low-fidelity prototype was built based on user requirements and from the first author's own experience as a researcher with cerebral palsy. After several design and evaluation iterations, a functional prototype has been evaluated in a real context with real users. Preliminary results indicate that the proposed system is suitable for both people with and without motor disabilities, and provides an adequate method for controlling home appliances when there is a family member with motor disabilities.

"In filamentary RRAM, the role of self-heating in set/reset (by ion transport) is well established. However, in nonfilamentary Pr0.7Ca0.3MnO3 (PCMO) RRAM, self-heating during set/reset has not been explored. Recently, we have shown self-heating to explain nonlinearity in dc IV characteristics. In this paper, we present the observation of self-heating using transient current during pulses. We show that the cooling timescale is limited bymeasurement system timescale (similar to 30 ns). The self-heating-based experimental current transient timescale is longer (50-100 ns) and is not described by simple exponential decay. To explain this behavior, self-heating in PCMO RRAM (where Joule heating and current increase create a positive feedback) is implemented into technology computer aided design simulations. Simulations produce excellent agreement with experiments. Eventually, simulations deviate from experiments when thermally assisted ionic transport during set/reset is not included in the model. To interrupt the continuous self-heating, an n-pulse-train with cooling time between pulses versus single pulse-based set/reset experiment was designed with the same peak bias time. Set/reset effectiveness degrades as n increases while effect of increasing cooling time confirmed a cooling timescale of similar to 30 ns. Overall, self-heating provides a consistent explanation of the transient currents. Thus, this paper establishes that self-heating considerations must be included for PCMO-based RRAM modeling and design.

"Microfluidics is an enabling technology for both cell biology and chemical analysis. We combine these attributes with a microfluidic device for on-line solid-phase extraction (SPE) and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of secreted metabolites from living cells in culture on the chip. The device was constructed with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and contains a reversibly sealed chamber for perfusing cells. A multilayer design allowed a series of valves to control an on-chip 7.5 mu L injection loop downstream of the cell chamber with operation similar to a six-port valve. The valve collects sample and then diverts it to a packed SPE bed that was connected in-line to treat samples prior to MS analysis. The valve allows samples to be collected and injected onto the SPE bed while preventing exposure of cells to added back pressure from the SPE bed and organic solvents needed to elute collected chemicals. Here, cultured murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes were loaded into the cell chamber and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) that were secreted by the cells were monitored by SPE-MS at 30 min intervals. The limit of detection for a palmitoleic acid standard was 1.4 mu M. Due to the multiplexed detection capabilities of MS, a variety of NEFAs were detected. Upon stimulation with isoproterenol and forskolin, secretion of select NEFAs was elevated an average of 1.5-fold compared to basal levels. Despite the 30-min delay between sample injections, this device is a step towards a miniaturized system that allows automated monitoring and identification of a variety of molecules in the extracellular environment.

"The authors show that two well-known and widely employed public-key encryption schemes - RSA optimal asymmetric encryption padding (RSA-OAEP) and Diffie-Hellman integrated encryption scheme (DHIES), instantiated with a one-time pad, - are secure under (the strong, simulation-based security notion of) selective opening security against chosen-ciphertext attacks in the random oracle model. Both schemes are obtained via known generic transformations that transform relatively weak primitives (with security in the sense of one-wayness) to indistinguishability (IND)-CCA secure encryption schemes. The authors also show a similar result for the well-known Fujisaki-Okamoto transformation that can generically turn a one-way secure public key encryption system and a one-time pad into a IND-CCA-secure public-key encryption system. The authors prove that selective opening security comes for free in these transformations. Both DHIES and RSA-OAEP are important building blocks in several standards for public key encryption and key exchange protocols. The Fujisaki-Okamoto transformation is very versatile and has successfully been utilised to build efficient lattice-based cryptosystems. The considered schemes are the first practical cryptosystems that meet the strong notion of simulation-based selective opening (SIM-SO-CCA) security.

"Existing mountain permafrost distribution models generally offer a good overview of the potential extent of this phenomenon at a regional scale. They are however not always able to reproduce the high spatial discontinuity of permafrost at the micro-scale (scale of a specific landform; ten to several hundreds of meters). To overcome this lack, we tested an alternative modelling approach using three classification algorithms belonging to statistics and machine learning: Logistic regression, Support Vector Machines and Random forests. These supervised learning techniques infer a classification function from labelled training data (pixels of permafrost absence and presence) with the aim of predicting the permafrost occurrence where it is unknown. The research was carried out in a 588 km(2) area of the Western Swiss Alps. Permafrost evidences were mapped from ortho-image interpretation (rock glacier inventorying) and field data (mainly geoelectrical and thermal data). The relationship between selected permafrost evidences and permafrost controlling factors was computed with the mentioned techniques. Classification performances, assessed with AUROC, range between 0.81 for Logistic regression, 0.85 with Support Vector Machines and 0.88 with Random forests. The adopted machine learning algorithms have demonstrated to be efficient for permafrost distribution modelling thanks to consistent results compared to the field reality. The high resolution of the input dataset (10 m) allows elaborating maps at the micro-scale with a modelled permafrost spatial distribution less optimistic than classic spatial models. Moreover, the probability output of adopted algorithms offers a more precise overview of the potential distribution of mountain permafrost than proposing simple indexes of the permafrost favorability. These encouraging results also open the way to new possibilities of permafrost data analysis and mapping. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"The flow of power law fluids, which include shear thinning and shear thickening as well as Newtonian as a special case, in networks of interconnected elastic tubes is investigated using a residual-based pore scale network modeling method with the employment of newly derived formulae. Two relations describing the mechanical interaction between the local pressure and local cross-sectional area in distensible tubes of elastic nature are considered in the derivation of these formulae. The model can be used to describe shear dependent flows of mainly viscous nature. The behavior of the proposed model is vindicated by several tests in a number of special and limiting cases where the results can be verified quantitatively or qualitatively. The model, which is the first of its kind, incorporates more than one major nonlinearity corresponding to the fluid rheology and conduit mechanical properties, that is non-Newtonian effects and tube distensibility. The formulation, implementation, and performance indicate that the model enjoys certain advantages over the existing models such as being exact within the restricting assumptions on which the model is based, easy implementation, low computational costs, reliability, and smooth convergence. The proposed model can, therefore, be used as an alternative to the existing Newtonian distensible models; moreover, it stretches the capabilities of the existing modeling approaches to reach non-Newtonian rheologies.

"The interleaved multilevel DC-DC converters have advantages of low voltage stress of the switches and diodes and reduction of filter size. Particularly series input parallel output (ISOP) configuration is well suited for high output voltage and large output current application but input series output series (ISOS) configuration enable the utilization of low voltage rating switches in high voltage input and high voltage output applications that require galvanic isolation. The series connection of the isolated DC-DC converters at the input side also can be used for higher voltage application. While multilevel topology offers many new features, it also necessitates a balance control of the input capacitors. The paper describes the operating principles of the balancing circuit, analyzes the fundamental relationships, introduces principles of the operation of the circuit. The paper shows experimental results based on a few practical application examples. The paper discusses design of the transformer with balancing winding for ISOP, ISOS and parallel connection of the DC-DC converters to provide independent voltage balancing of input capacitors.

"The high incidence of esophageal cancer in Northeast India and the unique ethnic background and dietary habits provide a great opportunity to study the molecular genetics behind esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in this part of the region. We hypothesized that in addition to currently known environmental risk factors for esophageal cancer, genetic and epigenetic factors are also involved in esophageal carcinogenesis in Northeast India. Therefore, in this study, we explored the possible association between the two important G1 cell cycle regulatory genes p16 and p53 and environmental risk factors and risk of esophageal carcinogenesis. A total of 100 newly diagnosed esophageal cancer cases along with equal number of age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched controls were included in this study. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the p16 promoter methylation status. Single-nucleotide polymorphism at codon 72 of p53 gene was assessed by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Aberrant methylation of p16 gene was seen in 81% of esophageal cancer cases. Hypermethylation of p16 gene was not found in healthy controls. p53 Pro/Pro genotype was found to be a risk genotype in Northeast India compared with Arg/Pro and Arg/Arg. p53 variant/polymorphism was significantly associated with esophageal cancer risk in the study population under all three genetic models, namely, dominant model (Arg/Pro+Pro/Pro vs Arg/Arg odds ratio=2.25, confidence interval=1.19-4.26; p=0.012), recessive model (Arg/Arg+Arg/Pro vs Pro/Pro odds ratio=2.35, confidence interval=1.24-4.44; p=0.008), and homozygous model (Pro/Pro vs Arg/Arg odds ratio=3.33, confidence interval=1.54-7.20; p=0.002). However, p53 variant/polymorphism was not statistically associated with esophageal cancer risk under the heterozygous model (Pro/Pro vs Arg/Pro). In the case-only analysis based on p16 methylation, the p53 variant/polymorphism (Pro/Pro or Arg/Pro) showed significant association for esophageal cancer risk (odds ratio=3.33, confidence interval=1.54-7.20; p=0.002). Gene-gene and gene-environment interaction using the case-only approach revealed a strong association between p16 methylation, p53 single-nucleotide polymorphism, and environmental factors and esophageal cancer risk. Cases with p16 methylation and p53 variant/polymorphism (Pro/Pro or Arg/Pro) along with both betel quid and tobacco chewing habit (odds ratio=8.29, confidence interval=1.14-60.23; p=0.037) conferred eightfold increased risk toward esophageal cancer development. This study reveals a synergistic interaction between epigenetic, genetic, and environmental factors and risk of esophageal cancer in this high-incidence region of Northeast India. The inactivation of either p16 or p53 in a majority of esophageal cancer cases in this study suggests the possible crosstalk between the important cell cycle genes.

"NanoMagnet logic (NML) is among the emerging technologies that might replace CMOS in the next decades. According to its physical characteristics, to better exploit the potential of this technology-and of other similar ones-the use of parallel architectures with regular layout that avoid long interconnection signals is advised. Systolic arrays (SAs) are among these architectures, being composed of a grid of equal processing elements that are locally interconnected. However, they are usually implemented to execute only a small set of algorithms, and for this reason, throughout the years, they have not been an appealing solution for CMOS. To seriously analyze the potentials of NML, complex architectures must be conceived, and their physical implementation explored considering realistic technological constraints. With the increasing complexity of NML circuits, two issues, then, are noticed: 1) the need for a regular structure arises, that at the same time helps to reduce the intrinsic pipelining nature of NML and can be configured to be used for several applications without developing a dedicated design for each algorithm and 2) the capability to synthesize, place and route NML circuits is fundamental to demonstrate the feasibility of the architecture in two important conditions: efficiently managing the complexity of the design and sticking to the characteristics that are technologically feasible at the time of writing. In this paper, we address these issues presenting a new reconfigurable SA that can be programmed to execute different algorithms, and we provide two examples to show its working principle. Moreover, the array is synthesized and simulated with the aid of the first real tool for nanotechnology circuits that we have conceived, Torino Politecnico Nanotechnology tool. The joint contribution at both the architectural and physical design levels gives a relevant step forward to the state of the art in the demonstration of this emerging technology potential.

"In order to minimize the environmental problems caused by pollution, public, private and third sector organizations began adopting environmental marketing strategies as a tool to meet a growing demand from concerned stakeholders with the environmental crisis. Among the many organizations that cause negative environmental impacts and that are regulated by environmental agencies, stand out the gas stations. Thus, this study aimed to characterize the environmental marketing actions taken by municipal gas station Sao Gabriel -RS. Several interviews were conducted with managers of the city's gas stations. It was found in relation to environmental issues: employees are aware about the environmental problems; at gas stations reusing water is not made used in car washes or rainwater harvesting; the posts there is a suitable place for storage of materials and waste, and these are stored in covered places and their packaging is made in resistant and sealed containers; all stations have contingency plans to minimize leakage of fuel, offering trained staff in case of situations like explosions, accidents in normal operations or products leak. There are many differences between the perceptions of managers in relation to environmental issues, however, the results revealed that the Sao Gabriel municipality of gas stations -RS work within the standards set by legislation, since adopt all measures required by the inspectors in the environmental context.

"This paper proposes an axial-flux-modulation permanent magnet (PM) machine and its sensorless control strategy for in-wheel application in electrical vehicles. A Vernier structure is integrated with the axial-flux PM machine to include the magnetic gear effect and improve output torque. The sensorless control strategy of the proposed machine, including initial rotor position estimation and rotating position estimation, is proposed for flux-modulation motors in this paper. The initial rotor position estimation is based on the technique of rectangular pulse voltage injection and the rotating rotor position estimation is based on the sliding mode observer (SMO). The saturation effect on inductances, which is the theoretical basis of the rectangular pulse voltage injection, makes the stator parameter variation in different loads and affects the SMO estimation. To overcome this problem, a novel online parameter self-adjustment procedure for the SMOis introduced. The machine design and its sensorless control performance are verified by simulation and prototype experiments.

"Previous work has shown there are robust differences in how North Americans and East Asians form impressions of people. The present research examines whether the tendency to weigh initial information more heavilythe primacy effectmay be another component of these cultural differences. Specifically, we tested whether Americans would be more likely to use first impressions to guide person perception, compared to Japanese participants. In this experiment, participants read a vignette that described a target person's behaviour, then rated the target's personality. Before reading the vignette, some trait information was given to create an expectation about the target's personality. The data revealed that Americans used this initial information to guide their judgments of the target, whereas the Japanese sample based their judgments on all the information more evenly. Thus, Americans showed a stronger primacy effect in their impression formation than Japanese participants, who engaged in more data-driven processing.

"Optogenetics is a technique exploded in the last 10 years, which revolutionized several areas of biological research. The brightest side of this technology is the use of light to modulate non-invasively, with high spatial resolution and millisecond time scale, excitable cells genetically modified to express light-sensitive microbial ion channels (opsins). Neuroscience has first benefited from such fascinating strategy, in intact organisms. By shining light to specific neuronal subpopulations, optogenetics allowed unearth the mechanisms involved in cell-to-cell communication within the context of intact organs, such as the brain, formed by complex neuronal circuits. More recently, scientists looked at optogenetics as a tool to answer some of the questions, remained in the dark, of cardiovascular physiology. In this review, we focus on the application of optogenetics in the study of the heart, a complex multicellular organ, homing different populations of excitable cells, spatially and functionally interconnected. Moving from the first proof-of-principle works, published in 2010, to the present time, we discuss the in vitro and in vivo applications of optogenetics for the study of electrophysiology of the different cardiac cell types, and for the dissection of cellular mechanisms underlying arrhythmias. We also present how molecular biology and technology foster the evolution of cardiac optogenetics, with the aim to further our understanding of fundamental questions in cardiac physiology and pathology. Finally, we confer about the therapeutic potential of such biotechnological strategy for the treatment of heart rhythm disturbances (e.g. cardiac pacing, cardioversion). (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"In big data era, how to process large-scale data stream is one of the existing challenges. Feature extraction method has attracted much attention because of its effectiveness to data classification. Traditional classification algorithms may take less advantage of labeled samples information. Online learning and out-of-sample problems are also hot topics recently. To solve these problems, a novel algorithm named semi-supervised incremental feature extraction algorithm is proposed in this paper. First, we extract feature incrementally in unsupervised way. Then we propose a semi-supervised subspace learning algorithm by taking advantage of class information to adjust k-nearest neighbor weights. Third, we combine the unsupervised and semi-supervised feature extraction approaches to obtain objective function, in order to solve the out-of-sample learning problem. Experiments have been carried out on Machine learning datasets of University of California Irvine (UCI) datasets and real-world face image datasets (Olivetti faces (ORL), Yale, YaleB, and Rendered face). To demonstrate the proposed algorithm's expandability to process the large-scale data stream, classification experiments using Spark skill in parallel computation environment are performed, with comparisons with some related semi-supervised feature extraction methods. The experiment results and computational complex comparison demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can obtain good performance. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

"The confounded signal hypothesis maintains that facial expressions of anger and happiness, in order to more efficiently communicate threat or nurturance, evolved forms that take advantage of older gender recognition systems, which were already attuned to similar affordances. Two unexplored consequences of this hypothesis are (1) facial gender should automatically interfere with discriminations of anger and happiness, and (2) controlled attentional processes (like working memory) may be able to override the interference of these particular expressions on gender discrimination. These issues were explored by administering a Garner interference task along with a working memory task as an index of controlled attention. Results show that those with good attentional control were able to eliminate interference of expression on gender decisions but not the interference of gender on expression decisions. Trials in which the stimulus attributes were systematically correlated also revealed strategic facilitation for participants high in attentional control.

"Metastasis accounts for the high mortality rate associated with colorectal cancer (CRC), but metastasis regulators are not fully understood. To identify a novel gene involved in tumor metastasis, we used oligonucleotide microarrays, transcriptome distance analyses, and machine learning algorithms to determine links between primary and metastatic colorectal cancers. Aminopeptidase A (APA; also known as ENPEP) was selected as our focus because its relationship with colorectal cancer requires clarification. Higher APA mRNA levels were observed in patients in advanced stages of cancer, suggesting a correlation between ENPEP and degree of malignancy. Our data also indicate that APA overexpression in CRC cells induced cell migration, invasion, anchorage-independent capability, and mesenchyme-like characteristics (e.g., EMT markers). We also observed TWIST induction in APA-overexpressing SW480 cells and TWIST down-regulation in HT29 cells knocked down with APA. Both APA silencing and impaired APA activity were found to reduce migratory capacity, cancer anchorage, stemness properties, and drug resistance in vitro and in vivo. We therefore suggest that APA enzymatic activity affects tumor initiation and cancer malignancy in a TWIST-dependent manner. Results from RT-qPCR and the immunohistochemical staining of specimens taken from CRC patients indicate a significant correlation between APA and TWIST. According to data from SurvExpress analyses of TWIST1 and APA mRNA expression profiles, high APA and TWIST expression are positively correlated with poor CRC prognosis. APA may act as a prognostic factor and/or therapeutic target for CRC metastasis and recurrence.

"Vaccine development against extracellular bacteria has been important for the sustainability of the aquaculture industry. In contrast, infections with intracellular pathogens remain largely an unresolved problem. Francisella noatunensis subsp. orientalis is a Gram-negative, facultative intracellular bacterium that causes the disease francisellosis in fish. Francisellosis is commonly characterized as a chronic granulomatous disease with high morbidity and can result in high mortality depending on the host. In this study, we explored the potential of bacterial membrane vesicles (MVs) as a vaccine agent against F. noatunensis subsp. orientalis. Bacterial MVs are spherical structures naturally released from the membrane of bacteria and are often enriched with selected bacterial components such as toxins and signaling molecules. MVs were isolated from broth-cultured F. noatunensis subsp. orientalis in the present work, and proteomic analysis by mass spectrometry revealed that MVs contained a variety of immunogenic factors, including the intracellular growth proteins lgIC and lgIB, known to be part of a Francisella pathogenicity island (FPI), as well as outer membrane protein OmpA, chaperonin GroEL, and chaperone ClpB. By using flow cytometry and electron microscopy, we observed that F. noatunensis subsp. orientalis mainly infects myelomonocytic cells, both in vivo and in vitro. Immunization with MVs isolated from F. noatunensis subsp. orientalis protects zebrafish from subsequent challenge with a lethal dose of F. noatunensis subsp. orientalis. To determine if MVs induce a typical acute inflammatory response, mRNA expression levels were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. Expression of tnfa, il1b, and ifng, as well as mhcii, mpeg1.1, and ighm, was upregulated, thus confirming the immunogenic properties of F. noatunensis subsp. orientalis-derived MVs.

"As most future automotive innovations will be realized with software, the automotive industry is facing a transition from mechanical to software engineering. To achieve successful product launches, this is also true for manufacturing engineering. This paper presents an empirical study of the interaction between the organizations for product development and manufacturing, specifically focusing on automotive software engineering. It is presented as a multiple case study with a qualitative approach where data were collected from documents and in interviews with practioners at two Swedish automotive companies. To obtain validity of the results, multiple information sources were triangulated in within-case analysis and cross-case analysis. It can be concluded that there are challenges in the research area since 18 issues emerged from the data. Furthermore, a majority of the findings were supported by data sources from both cases, which indicates a possibility to generalize the results to the automotive domain.

"The mirror neuron system (MNS) has been mooted as a crucial component underlying human social cognition. Initial evidence based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) suggests that the MNS plays a role in emotion classification, but further confirmation and convergent evidence is needed. This study employed electroencephalography (EEG) to examine modulations in the mu rhythm associated with the inference of emotions from facial expressions. It was hypothesised that mu suppression would be associated with classifying the emotion portrayed by facial expressions. Nineteen participants viewed pictures of facial expressions or emotion words and were asked to either match the stimulus to an emotion word or to passively observe. Mu activity following stimulus presentation was localised using a 3-D distributed inverse solution, and compared between conditions. Subtractive logic was used to isolate the specific processes of interest. Comparisons of source localisation images between conditions revealed that there was mu suppression associated with recognising emotion from faces, thereby supporting our hypothesis. Further analyses confirmed that those effects were not due to activity associated with the motor response or the observation of facial expressions, offering further support for the hypotheses. This study provides important convergent evidence for the involvement of the MNS in the inference of emotion from facial expressions.

"We consider the problem of automatically re-identifying a person of interest seen in a probe camera view among several candidate people in a gallery camera view. This problem, called person re-identification, is of fundamental importance in several video analytics applications. While extracting knowledge from high dimensional visual representations based on the notions of sparsity and regularization has been successful for several computer vision problems, such techniques have not been fully exploited in the context of the re-identification problem. Here, we develop a principled algorithm for the re-identification problem in the general framework of learning sparse visual representations. Given a set of feature vectors for a person in one camera view (corresponding to multiple images as they are tracked), we show that a feature vector representing the same person in another view approximately lies in the linear span of this feature set. Furthermore, under certain conditions, the associated coefficient vector can be characterized as being block sparse. This key insight allows us to design an algorithm based on block sparse recovery that achieves stateof-the-art results in multi-shot person re-identification. We also revisit an older feature transformation technique, Fisher discriminant analysis, and show that, when combined with our proposed formulation, it outperforms many sophisticated methods. Additionally, we show that the proposed algorithm is flexible and can be used in conjunction with existing metric learning algorithms, resulting in improved ranking performance. We perform extensive experiments on several publicly available datasets to evaluate the proposed algorithm. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"The present research investigates whether spontaneous trait inferences occur under conditions characteristic of social media and networking sites: nonextreme, ostensibly self-generated content, simultaneous presentation of multiple cues, and self-paced browsing. We used an established measure of trait inferences (false recognition paradigm) and a direct assessment of impressions. Without being asked to do so, participants spontaneously formed impressions of people whose status updates they saw. Our results suggest that trait inferences occurred from nonextreme self-generated content, which is commonly found in social media updates (Experiment 1) and when nine status updates from different people were presented in parallel (Experiment 2). Although inferences did occur during free browsing, the results suggest that participants did not necessarily associate the traits with the corresponding status update authors (Experiment 3). Overall, the findings suggest that spontaneous trait inferences occur on social media. We discuss implications for online communication and research on spontaneous trait inferences.

"The gut microbiota includes a community of bacteria that play an integral part in host health and biological processes. Pronounced and repeated findings have linked gut microbiome to stress, anxiety, and depression. Currently, however, there remains only a limited set of studies focusing on microbiota change in substance abuse, including alcohol use disorder. To date, no studies have investigated the impact of vapour alcohol administration on the gut microbiome. For research on gut microbiota and addiction to proceed, an understanding of how route of drug administration affects gut microbiota must first be established. Animal models of alcohol abuse have proven valuable for elucidating the biological processes involved in addiction and alcohol-related diseases. This is the first study to investigate the effect of vapour route of ethanol administration on gut microbiota in mice. Adult male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to 4 weeks of chronic intermittent vapourized ethanol (CIE, N= 10) or air (Control, N = 9). Faecal samples were collected at the end of exposure followed by 16S sequencing and bioinformatic analysis. Robust separation between CIE and Control was seen in the microbiome, as assessed by alpha (p < 0.05) and beta (p < 0.001) diversity, with a notable decrease in alpha diversity in CIE. These results demonstrate that CIE exposure markedly alters the gut microbiota in mice. Significant increases in genus Alistipes (p < 0.001) and significant reductions in genra Clostridium IV and XIVb (p <0.001), Dorea (p < 0.01), and Coprococcus (p < 0.01) were seen between CIE mice and Control. These findings support the viability of the CIE method for studies investigating the microbiota-gut-brain axis and align with previous research showing similar microbiota alterations in inflammatory states during alcoholic hepatitis and psychological stress.

"Considering the major requirements for automotive applications i.e., high torque and power density, low torque ripple, wide speed range, and high speed operation capability, the synchronous reluctance machine is still under intensive investigation. As a traction motor, the proper operation of the SynRM at low and high speeds is desired, the magnetic and mechanical performance of the core structure are important challenges. Therefore, prior to the final design, these need to be analyzed with regards to the core magnetic behavior and mechanical robustness which cause degradation in torque quality and harmful deformation at critical points in the rotor structure. At low speed, the high current demand at maximum torque makes the core magnetic performance dominant, whereas at high speed the mechanical behavior of the rotor core structure limits the machine performance. This paper presents a comparative analysis of different core characteristics to improve the core magnetic and mechanical performance of the SynRM equipped with a transversal laminated anisotropic rotor type for automotive applications.

"The solar photovoltaic (PV) system is known as one of the most outstanding new renewable energy systems for achieving the nearly zero energy building (nZEB). For the continuous deployment of the solar PV system in urban environments, it is crucial to estimate the rooftop solar PV potential. Urban areas, however, where high-rise buildings abound, are not always suitable for solar PV installation. Therefore, it is important to accurately estimate the available rooftop area considering the shadows from the surrounding buildings for reliable rooftop solar PV potential estimation. Therefore, this study proposed a method for estimating the rooftop solar PV potential by analyzing the available rooftop area through Hillshade analysis. Toward this end, the rooftop solar PV potential was estimated through the following hierarchical process: (i) calculation of the physical potential; (ii), calculation of the geographic potential; and (iii) calculation of the technical potential. For accurate estimation of the rooftop solar PV potential, the geographic potential (i.e., the available rooftop area) was explored in detail by analyzing the shadow based on the location of the sun through Hillshade analysis. By applying the proposed method to the Gangnam district in Seoul, South Korea, this study estimated the physical, geographic, and technical potentials on hourly, monthly, and annual bases. Overall, the physical, geographic, and technical potentials in the Gangnam district were found to be 9,287,982 MW h, 4,964,118 m(2), and 1,130,371 MW h, respectively. These rooftop solar PV potential results can be used in establishing solar policies by analyzing the different levels of the rooftop solar PV potential on hourly, monthly, and annual bases.

"1-Phenyl-2-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)octan-1-one (PV9) and 16 metabolites, including diastereomers and conjugates, were identified or tentatively detected in human urine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry. These urinary metabolites indicated that the metabolic pathways of PV9 include: (1) the reduction of ketone groups to their corresponding alcohols; (2) oxidation of the pyrrolidine ring to the corresponding pyrrolidone; (3) aliphatic oxidation of the terminal carbon atom to the corresponding carboxylate form, possibly through an alcohol intermediate (not detected); and (4) hydroxylation at the penultimate carbon atom to the corresponding alcohols followed by further oxidation to ketones, and combinations of these steps. In addition, results from the quantitative analyses of five phase-I metabolites using newly synthesized authentic standards suggested that the main metabolic pathway includes the aliphatic oxidation of terminal and/or penultimate carbons. Human metabolism of PV9 differed significantly from those of alpha-pyrrolidinovalerophenone and alpha-pyrrolidinobutiophenone, suggesting that the main metabolic pathways of alpha-pyrrolidinophenones significantly change depending on the alkyl chain length of the parent molecule.

"Computer aided process planning (CAPP) is an important bridge between computer aided design (CAD) and computer aided manufacturing (CAM) in computer integrated manufacturing environment. Operation sequence generation is one of the most difficult tasks in CAPP. The aim of operation sequencing in CAPP is to determine the best order of machining operations with minimal manufacturing cost while satisfying all the precedence constraints. This paper presents a proposed method for optimizing operation sequence using modified clustering algorithm. The key concept of method is that the precedence constraints are firstly checked for selecting all possible next operations of the last operation in the sequence and their traveling costs are compared to choose the optimal feasible operation which has the minimum traveling cost in the sequence. Then, all operation sequences are calculated the total traveling cost for obtaining the optimal sequence result. Because of removing all unfeasible sequences at the beginning of procedure and selecting the optimal operation into sequence in each step, the time can be significantly reduced. The capability and performance of the proposed method are demonstrated in three specific case studies. The comparisons show that the proposed method can solve the problem in much lesser computational time while generating more alternate optimal feasible sequences than previous algorithms.

"In order to improve the fault monitoring performance of grounding electrode lines in ultra-high voltage DC (UHVDC) transmission systems, a novel fault monitoring approach based on the high-frequency voltage standing-wave ratio (VSWR) is proposed in this paper. The VSWR is defined considering a lossless transmission line, and the characteristics of the VSWR under different conditions are analyzed. It is shown that the VSWR equals 1 when the terminal resistance completely matches the characteristic impedance of the line, and when a short circuit fault occurs on the grounding electrode line, the VSWR will be greater than 1. The VSWR will approach positive infinity under metallic earth fault conditions, whereas the VSWR in non-metallic earth faults will be smaller. Based on these analytical results, a fault supervision criterion is formulated. The effectiveness of the proposed VSWR-based fault supervision technique is verified with a typical UHVDC project established in Power Systems Computer Aided Design/Electromagnetic Transients including DC(PSCAD/EMTDC). Simulation results indicate that the proposed strategy can reliably identify the grounding electrode line fault and has strong anti-fault resistance capability.

"The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the oxidative and reductive metabolic pathways of acrylamide (AA) in the nonsmoking general population. For the first time both the blood protein adducts and the urinary metabolites of AA and glycidamide (GA) were quantified in an especially designed study group with even distribution of age and gender. The hemoglobin adducts N-carbamoylethylvaline (AAVal) and N-(R,S)-2-hydroxy-2-carbamoylethylvaline (GAVal) were detected by GC-MS/MS in all blood samples with median levels of 30 and 34 pmol/g of globin, respectively. Concentrations ranged from 15 to 71 pmol/g of globin for AAVal and from 14 to 66 pmol/g of globin for GAVal. The ratio GAVal/AAVal was 0.4-2.7 (median = 1.1). The urinary metabolites were determined by LC-MS/MS. Of all urine samples examined 99% of N-acetyl-S-(2-carbamoylethyl)-L-cysteine (AAMA) levels and 73% of N-(R/S)-acetyl-S-(2-carbamoyl-2-hydroxyethyl)-L-cysteine (GAMA) levels were above the LOD (1.5 mu g/L). Concentrations ranged from < LOD to 229 mu g/L (median = 29 mu g/L) for AAMA and from < LOD to 85 mu g/L (median = 7 mu g/L) for GAMA. The ratio of GAMA/AAMA varied from 0.004 to 1.4 (median = 0.3). Using hemoglobin adduct levels in blood and mercapturic acid excretion in urine for calculation of daily AA intake gave practically identical values. The median daily intakes were 0.43 (0.21-1.04) mu g/kg of body weight(bw)/day using Hb adducts and 0.51 (< LOD-2.32) mu g/kg of bw/day using mercapturic acids for calculations. Children take up approximately 1.3-1.5 times more AA per kilogram of body weight than adults. The ratio GAMA/AAMA is significantly higher in the group of young children (6-10 years) with a median level of 0.5. A gender-related difference in internal exposure and metabolism was not observed.

"This paper examines university student's perceptions of gender differences with regards to the visual and tactile interaction involved in corporal expression activities. The study is based on a content analysis of the work experience diaries of 34 students (22.26 +/- 2.87 years) from the University of Zaragoza (Spain). Data was processed using the NVIVO 8 software. Results showed: i) activities that require a higher level of emotional involvement engender a higher perception of gender differences; ii) women are perceived as more expressive than men; iii) there is a visual preference for the opposite sex; and iv) men are fearful of touching women. Results lead to the conclusion that didactic intervention that involves tactile and visual interaction should be sequenced in tasks of lesser to greater emotional commitment and incorporate actions and instructions that facilitate the rupture of gender attributions that impede expression.

"The article focuses on development of intercultural awareness in teaching of professional Russian. The formation of intercultural competence represents one of key elements in professional teaching of specialists. The intercultural competence comprises skills which are vital both for verbal and nonverbal communication with foreign language native speakers, requiring the perception and management of various socially and culturally rooted language phenomena and consideration of cultural peculiarities pertaining to the country of the language being studied. The need to develop such competence poses new challenges to teachers by requiring from them to develop a new perception of learning goals. The respective article dwells on didactic aspects of learners' adaptation to peculiarities of a foreign culture, as well as on teaching of effective communication to achieve professional goals by considering the intercultural factor. Various didactic techniques are therein analysed, namely the linguo-conceptual approach in teaching of a foreign language, formation of discourse frames necessary for professional and everyday communication, exercises with texts containing culturological information. The tailor-made system of exercises is targeted at eliminating possible communication failures inflicted by cultural discrepancies. The purpose is to achieve the level of competence which is sufficient for an adequate and correct implementation of communication goals in analysed situations of everyday and business communication.

"Cognitive deficits are pervasive among people with schizophrenia and treatment options are limited. There has been an increased interest in the neurocognitive benefits of exercise, but a comprehensive evaluation of studies to date is lacking. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis of all controlled trials investigating the cognitive outcomes of exercise interventions in schizophrenia. Studies were identified from a systematic search across major electronic databases from inception to April 2016. Meta-analyses were used to calculate pooled effect sizes (Hedges g) and 95% CIs. We identified 10 eligible trials with cognitive outcome data for 385 patients with schizophrenia. Exercise significantly improved global cognition (g = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.13-0.53, P = .001) with no statistical heterogeneity (I-2 = 0%). The effect size in the 7 studies which were randomized controlled trials was g = 0.43 (P < .001). Meta-regression analyses indicated that greater amounts of exercise are associated with larger improvements in global cognition (beta = .005, P = .065). Interventions which were supervised by physical activity professionals were also more effective (g = 0.47, P < .001). Exercise significantly improved the cognitive domains of working memory (g = 0.39, P = .024, N = 7, n = 282), social cognition (g = 0.71, P = .002, N = 3, n = 81), and attention/vigilance (g = 0.66, P = .005, N = 3, n = 104). Effects on processing speed, verbal memory, visual memory and reasoning and problem solving were not significant. This meta-analysis provides evidence that exercise can improve cognitive functioning among people with schizophrenia, particularly from interventions using higher dosages of exercise. Given the challenges in improving cognition, and the wider health benefits of exercise, a greater focus on providing supervised exercise to people with schizophrenia is needed.

"As one of the candidate tritium breeding blankets for Chinese Fusion Engineering Test Reactor (CFETR), a conceptual structure of the helium cooled solid breeder blanket has recently been proposed. The neutronic, thermal-hydraulic and mechanical characteristics of the blanket directly affect its tritium breeding and safety performance. Therefore, neutronic/thermal-hydraulic/mechanical coupling analyses are of vital importance for a reliable blanket design. In this work, first, three-dimensional neutronics analysis and optimization of the typical outboard equatorial blanket module (No. 12) were performed for the comprehensive optimal scheme. Then, thermal and fluid dynamic analyses of the scheme under both normal and critical conditions were performed and coupled with the previous neutronic calculation results. With thermal-hydraulic boundaries, thermo-mechanical analyses of the structure materials under normal, critical and blanket over-pressurization conditions were carried out. In addition, several parametric sensitivity studies were also conducted to investigate the influences of the main parameters on the blanket temperature distributions. In this paper, the coupled analyses verify the reasonability of the optimized conceptual design preliminarily and can provide an important reference for the further analysis and optimization design of the CFETR helium cooled solid breeder blanket.

"Revocation and key evolving paradigms are central issues in cryptography, and in PKI in particular. A novel concern related to these areas was raised in the recent work of Sahai, Seyalioglu, and Waters (CRYPTO 2012) who noticed that revoking past keys should at times (e.g., the scenario of cloud storage) be accompanied by revocation of past ciphertexts (to prevent unread ciphertexts from being read by revoked users). They introduced revocable-storage attribute-based encryption (RS-ABE) as a good access control mechanism for cloud storage. RS-ABE protects against the revoked users not only the future data by supporting key-revocation but also the past data by supporting ciphertext-update, through which a ciphertext at time T can be updated to a new ciphertext at time T 1 using only the public key. Motivated by this pioneering work, we ask whether it is possible to have a modular approach, which includes a primitive for time managed ciphertext update as a primitive. We call encryption which supports this primitive a self-updatable encryption (SUE). We then suggest a modular cryptosystems design methodology based on three sub-components: a primary encryption scheme, a key-revocation mechanism, and a time-evolution mechanism which controls the ciphertext self-updating via an SUE method, coordinated with the revocation (when needed). Our goal in this is to allow the self-updating ciphertext component to take part in the design of new and improved cryptosystems and protocols in a flexible fashion. Specifically, we achieve the following results: We first introduce a new cryptographic primitive called self-updatable encryption (SUE), realizing a time-evolution mechanism. In SUE, a ciphertext and a private key are associated with time. A user can decrypt a ciphertext if its time is earlier than that of his private key. Additionally, anyone (e.g., a cloud server) can update the ciphertext to a ciphertext with a newer time. We also construct an SUE scheme and prove its full security under static assumptions. Following our modular approach, we present a new RS-ABE scheme with shorter ciphertexts than that of Sahai et al. and prove its security. The length efficiency is mainly due to our SUE scheme and the underlying modularity. We apply our approach to predicate encryption (PE) supporting attribute-hiding property, and obtain a revocable storage PE (RS-PE) scheme that is selectively-secure. We further demonstrate that SUE is of independent interest, by showing it can be used for timed-release encryption (and its applications), and for augmenting key-insulated encryption with forward-secure storage.

"Most of approaches to salient object detection focused on two-dimensional images, while rare attention was attached to the light field which can provide exclusive visual information for salient object detection and other computer vision applications. An effective algorithm of salient object detection is proposed for light field data. First, boundary connectivity is calculated on all-focus image. Then, background probability based on boundary connectivity is achieved by computing geodesic distance. Second, the authors rank the similarity of the superpixels of both all-focus image and depth map via graph-based manifold ranking to carry out two initial saliency maps. Third, weighted by background probability, the two initial saliency maps are fused to produce final saliency results, integrated by objectness cue. The authors also exploit how to integrate effectively objectness with other visual features, and compare two fusion strategies: linear fusion and Bayesian integration. Experiments show that light field features are helpful for saliency detection, and Bayesian integration framework is the better choice than linear fusion method. Meanwhile, the way how to combine multiple features is crucial. The proposed algorithm handles challenging natural scenarios such as cluttered background, similar foreground and background, and so on, and produces visual favourable results in comparison with the eight state-of-the-art methods.

"Understanding and predicting whether new drug candidates will be safe in the clinic is a critical hurdle in pharmaceutical development, that relies in part on absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicology studies in vivo. Zebrafish is a relatively new model system for drug metabolism and toxicity studies, offering whole organism screening coupled with small size and potential for high-throughput screening. Through toxicity and absorption analyses of a number of drugs, we find that zebrafish is generally predictive of drug toxicity, although assay outcomes are influenced by drug lipophilicity which alters drug uptake. In addition, liver microsome assays reveal specific differences in metabolism of compounds between human and zebrafish livers, likely resulting from the divergence of the cytochrome P450 superfamily between species. To reflect human metabolism more accurately, we generated a transgenic humanized zebrafish line that expresses the major human phase I detoxifying enzyme, CYP3A4, in the liver. Here, we show that this humanized line shows an elevated metabolism of CYP3A4-specific substrates compared to wild-type zebrafish. The generation of this first described humanized zebrafish liver suggests such approaches can enhance the accuracy of the zebrafish model for toxicity prediction.

"Traditional PC based operating systems load most of its components during the boot process along with the kernel. This mechanism though effective for a broader objective, is seldom utilized fully by a majority of users as they usually perform a specific job which does not require every component of OS. It has been observed that operating systems which are designed keeping in mind the nature of job, achieve better performance than standard systems even on an inferior hardware. Sony's PlayStation 4 gives better performance per watt when compared to a PC having similar graphics configuration. The prime cause of this weak performance is wasting of resources due to generic purpose OS design. This paper proposes a novel technique which will enable more efficient utilization of the hardware. Many choices are available to the user and each choice corresponds to a different mode of operation. This is achieved using modular shell design wherein the resource deployment is done according to the requirements of module. There is an uniform base module to allow easy and fast access to user allowing him to perform most basic tasks. Each module of the operating system shall be loaded to perform a specific task and will provide user with an enhanced access to perform a job. The user can switch among the modules according his requirements. This will also allow specific components in a kernel to allocate resources only according to the needs of the program. This mechanism will provide the benefits of real time OS in a time shared environment and will allow coordinated control of resources not possible in a traditional UNIX based operating system.

"Beta-amyloid peptide (A beta) induced neurotoxicity is considered as a hallmark of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present study demonstrated the neuroprotective role of 5-HT6 receptors against A beta-induced neurotoxicity in PC-12 cells. The 5-HT6 receptor agonist EMD-386088 and antagonist SB-399885 were used as pharmacological tools. The NMDA receptor antagonist, memantine, was used as reference standard. The A beta(25-35) (50 A mu M) induced apoptosis, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and impaired neurite outgrowth in PC-12 cells. Pre-treatment with 10 A mu M EMD-386088 and SB-399885 had significantly protected neuronal cell death by maintaining higher cell viability through attenuation of intracellular ROS. Further, both compounds significantly prevented A beta(25-35)-induced impairment in neurite outgrowth in PC-12 cells. Similarly, memantine prevented A beta(25-35)-induced neurotoxicity in PC-12 cells. These findings suggest that 5-HT6 receptor ligands have protected neurons from A beta(25-35) induced toxicity by reducing ROS and through prevention of impairment in neurite outgrowth.

"Edge extraction from high spatial resolution (HSR) remotely sensed images is one of the essential tasks for image segmentation and object identification. We present an optimal Gabor-based edge detection method which mainly focuses on selecting optimal parameters, including central frequency and spectrum scale, for Gabor filter. The central frequency is automatically optimized by phase randomization and the human visual system-based structure similarity index. Next, the optimal spectrum scale is determined based on two-dimensional power spectrum density. The edge detection method is comprehensively discussed in the analysis of parameter sensitivity, overall performance, and comparative tests with several widely used methods. Qualitative and quantitative experimental studies, performed on six test images with various spatial resolution, show that the proposed method provides a promising solution to edge detection from HSR remotely sensed images.

"According to French standards, constructed wetlands for combined sewer overflow treatment (CSO CWs) are vertical flow filters with detention basin and outflow rate limitation. Their purpose is to treat rapid loads of wastewater with stochastic volumes, concentrations and periodicity. The first full-scale CSO CW has been monitored for three years, involving online equipment. This provided in-depth understanding of hydraulics and nitrogen dynamics. The saturation of the filter was visualized along a longitudinal section to follow hydraulics at filling. Tracer tests showed that short-circuiting effects, which are adverse, weaken during the process. This was confirmed by the decreasing NH4-N concentrations in the outflow. As such, short-circuiting can be addressed by minimizing filling time. As for nitrogen dynamics, NH4-N adsorption capacities were identical for the applied sand-zeolite mixture and pozzolana materials. To calculate inter-event nitrification of adsorbed masses, an equation was fitted to temperature and mass measurements. The rate doubled with every 5.7 degrees C. Finally, nitrate was found to get washed out by low hydraulic loads (median: 0.95 m(3)/m(2)), highlighting the possibility of developing a second filter stage for denitrification. The results helped to calibrate the design-support software Orage. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"Here we provide evidence that repeated immobilization stress (RIS) in rats induces a persistent increase in noradrenergic activity in the anterior aspects of the anterolateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (aIBNST). This increase in noradrenergic activity results from both enhanced synthesis and reuptake of norepinephrine (NE). It leads to a decrease in the synaptic availability of NE, which elicits an augmented noradrenergic response to the inhibitors of NE reuptake (NRIs), such as desipramine (DMI), an antidepressant. The enduring depression-like behavior and the augmentation of the climbing behavior seen in repeatedly stressed rats following subchronic administration of DMI in the forced swimming test (FST) might be explained by a dysregulation of noradrenergic transmission observed in alBNST. Taken together, we propose that dysregulation of noradrenergic transmission such as the one described in the present work may represent a mechanism underlying major depressive disorders (MDD) with melancholic features in humans.

"Digital image correlation (DIC) is one of the most widely used non-invasive methods for measuring full-field surface strains in a wide variety of applications. The DIC method has been used by numerous researchers for measuring strains during the plastic range of deformation where the strains are relatively large. The estimation of the amount of background strain error in the measurements is of prime importance for determining the applicability of this method for measuring small strains (such as the elastic strains in metals, ceramics, bone samples, etc.). In this study, the strain errors in 2D-DIC measurements associated with different types of imaging systems were investigated. In-plane rigid-body-translation, experiments were used to estimate the overall amount of error in DIC displacement and strain measurements. Different types of cameras having different types of sensors and different spatial resolutions were used in the study. Also, for the same type of camera, different types of lenses were used. Results show that the DIC measurement accuracy depends on the magnitude of image displacement and that different error estimation parameters can be used for quantifying the accuracy of the measurements. Also, the effect of the lens on measurement accuracy is more pronounced than that of the camera. Furthermore, imaging conditions such as image sharpness and camera gain also affect the accuracy. Further still, the measurement accuracy was found to be influenced by the direction of translation. The results indicate that measurement error can be reduced by orienting the camera such that the major displacement direction is parallel to the width direction of the image. The experimental approach used in this study can be used for quantitatively assessing the quality of the different types of cameras and lenses and to determine their suitability for use in experimental techniques that depend on image analysis such as DIC and particle image velocimetry (PIV).

"Water resource shortage and pollution has seriously threatened the survival and development of developing countries. Because of India's specific economical and social circumstances, complete adoption of developed countries experience is unrealistic. At present, India needs to develop strategies and technologies in source water pollution control and industrial and municipal environmental remediation that embrace the country's specific need to battle the water resource problem. This study was aimed to comparative variation in physico-chemical properties and heavy metals estimation of drinking water samples collected from different districts of Jharkhand, India and their water quality index. A total number of 28 water samples were collected from different sources like hand pumps, wells and taps. The gross appearance, pH, total hardness, Ca, Mg, total alkalinity, Na, K, Cl-, SO4-, NO3-, F-, TDS and heavy metals like Cu, Pb, Zn, Ni, Cd, Cr, Mn and Fe were analyzed. The results of physico-chemical parameters and heavy metals estimation of most of the water samples were found to be within acceptable limit as per IS-10500 and some of the samples from district Dhanbad, Bokaro, Ramgarh, Hazaribag area and Giridih showed slight variation from IS -10500. WQI value indicates that quality of water from all five districts is poor. The ground water for use of drinking purpose requires some treatment including removal of iron and softening.

"This article proposes a multiobjective optimization model for the design of a macroscopic water system of a Mexican city that solves simultaneously the planning and scheduling of water storage and distribution tasks. The model, which considers rainwater harvesting and reclaimed water reusing as alternative water sources, maximizes the revenues from water sales and minimizes simultaneously the water consumption and land use. A case study based on the city of Morelia in Mexico was solved. It was found that the use of alternative water sources (such as harvested rainwater) along with an appropriate planning and scheduling of storage and distribution tasks have the potential to reduce the pressure over natural reservoirs significantly. Our approach considers simultaneously economic and environmental concerns, thereby contributing to the implementation of more sustainable alternatives in urban water distribution.

"Synchronization with the utility voltage is naturally carried out by a diode bridge stage in single-phase active rectifiers, while an active synchronization is included in the control algorithms applied to modern bridgeless topologies. Sensorless line current rebuilding algorithms also need synchronization with the line voltage to compensate at least for part of the current estimation error. The phase-locked-loop (PLL) circuits employed in single-phase ac-dc converters are reviewed and a new digital PLL algorithm, based on the synchronous reference frame, is proposed. It is implemented in a field-programmable gate array to utilize the parallelism and superior time resolution. Considering a restricted frequency variation of the line voltage around the central frequency, the orthogonal signal is obtained by a discrete differential operator designed to ensure unity gain at the central frequency. Its performance, including the memory and computational cost, versus previously consolidated algorithms implemented in the same device is analyzed. Simulations and experimental results prove its suitable behavior in steady state at different line frequencies and under line voltage and frequency transients.

"DNA/RNA sequencing has recently become a primary way researchers generate biological data for further analysis. Assembling algorithms are an integral part of this process. However, some of them require pairwise alignment to be applied to a great deal of reads. Although several efficient alignment tools have been released over the past few years, including those taking advantage of GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), none of them directly targets high-throughput sequencing data. As a result, a need arose to create software that could handle such data as effectively as possible. G-DNA (GPU-based DNA aligner) is the first highly parallel solution that has been optimized to process nucleotide reads (DNA/RNA) from modern sequencing machines. Results show that the software reaches up to 89 GCUPS (Giga Cell Updates Per Second) on a single GPU and as a result it is the fastest tool in its class. Moreover, it scales up well on multiple GPUs systems, including MPI-based computational clusters, where its performance is counted in TCUPS (Tera CUPS).

"Background: The local recurrence rate in oral squamous cell cancer (OSCC) hardly decreases. This is partly due to the presence of (pre) malignant cells in the remaining tissue after resection, that may lead to the development of a new tumor in time. Detection of histologically (pre) malignant cells in the tumor resection margins should predict these patients at risk for recurrence, however this appears to be difficult in routine practice. Purpose of this study was to apply easy-to-use molecular tests for more accurate detection of (pre) malignant cells in histopathologically tumor-free margins, to improve diagnosis of patients at risk. Methods: 42 patients with firstly diagnosed, radically resected primary OSCC with histopathologically confirmed tumor-free resection margins (treated between 1994 and 2003) were included. Inclusion criteria comprised of follow-up >= 5 years, and radical surgery without postoperative treatment. Formalinf-ixed paraffine-embedded tissue sections of 42 tumors, 290 resection margins, and 11 recurrences were subjected to fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to examine chromosome 1 and 7 copy number variations (CNV), and to p53 immunohistochemistry (IHC). Results: 11 out of the 42 patients developed a local recurrence within 5 years. FISH analysis showed that nine of eleven recurrences exhibited CI in at least one of the resection margins (p = 0.008). P53 overexpression and routine histopathologic classification were not correlated with recurrent disease. The presence of CI in the resection margins revealed a significantly worse progression-free survival (log-rank p = 0.012). Conclusions: CI in the resection margins of OSCC can reliably identify patients at risk for developing a local recurrence. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"Caryophyllata Flos or clove is widely used as a condiment and in Chinese medicine. It reportedly helps relieve asthma and allergies; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In particular, the mechanism affecting dendritic cells (DCs), which play a critical role in the immune response, remains unknown. In this study, we examine the effects of Caryophyllata Flos methanolic extract (CFME) and its major compound, eugenol, on DC functions. Our results showed that CFME and eugenol significantly inhibited DC activation and maturation. The IC50s of CFME and eugenol were approximately 25 mu g/mL and 50 mu M, respectively. CFME and eugenol halted T-cell proliferation. Contact hypersensitivity responses were inhibited in mice cosensitized with either CFME or eugenol. We demonstrated for the first time that clove and its major active ingredient, eugenol, exhibited a significant immunosuppressive effect on DC functions, revealing that clove is a functional food that can ameliorate chronic inflammation and autoimmunity.

"The paper draws upon the controversy over the use of indigenous-related sports emblems that has recently sparked a series of protests across the United States against the Washington Redsk*ns name and imagery. It focuses on the visual aspect of the debate, tracing the white-supremacist foundations of the Washington team's insignia to the institutional construction of Native identity through popular Indian head pennies, gold coins, and buffalo nickels in the period between 1859 and 1938. Pointing at the seemingly paradoxical discrepancy between the minted messages and the systematic political, legal, and military invasion on American Indian sovereignty in that period, it proceeds to deconstruct the paradox by exposing the numismatic pictorial language as a manifestation of the same ideological project and the configurations of power that have remained unchanged to this day. The continued circulation of indigenous-based iconography in the contemporary American context shows that the same cultural imagination continues to serve not only as a powerful rationale for European America's historical, national, and political narrative but also as a form of anti-conquest that both obscures and enacts the established formulas of colonial domination and control. Observing the alterations of the Washington Redsk*ns logo design across some of the key socio-historical moments of the second half of the twentieth and the beginning of the twenty-first century, the analysis explores how various forms of national anxiety transcend into identity through the politics of representation. In that light, it regards recent activism against mass-mediated symbolization of indigenous identity as an important arena in which centuries-old hegemonic discourses are contested against new venues of self-determination and internal decolonization.

"In the context of a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) connected to the utility grid under unbalanced voltage conditions, the controller design needs to ensure additional challenges such as restricting the total harmonic distortion (THD) in grid current, minimizing the pulsations in generated power, torque, dc-link voltage, etc., apart from facilitating the generator power control. In this study, a negative-sequence compensation scheme for the magnetizing current in a DFIG is investigated. The reference currents are modified to include the negative-sequence compensating component for the magnetizing current. A rotor-side converter is employed to compensate the pulsations in magnetizing current thereby minimizing the ripple in power and torque. A grid-side converter is used to maintain unity power factor and a constant dc-link voltage. It is revealed that controlling the magnetizing current as a single control target enables simultaneous reduction of pulsations in torque, power, and dc-link voltage and also minimizes unbalance in currents. The effectiveness of the scheme is validated through detailed analysis and numerical simulations in PSCAD/EMTDC for a practical 250 kW DFIG wind generation system and further, through experimental results for a 2.3 kW DFIG test setup. Typical experimental results for the laboratory test setup show an improved performance.

"Sizing storage for rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems is often a difficult design consideration, as the system must be designed specifically for the local rainfall pattern. We introduce a generally applicable method for estimating the required storage by using regional regression equations to account for climatic differences in the behavior of RWH systems across the entire continental United States. A series of simulations for 231 locations with continuous daily precipitation records enable the development of storage-reliability-yield (SRY) relations at four useful reliabilities, 0.8, 0.9, 0.95, and 0.98. Multivariate, log-linear regression results in storage equations that include demand, collection area and local precipitation statistics. The continental regression equations demonstrated excellent goodness-of-fit (R-2 0.96-0.99) using only two precipitation parameters, and fits improved when three geographic regions with more homogeneous rainfall characteristics were considered. The SRY models can be used to obtain a preliminary estimate of how large to build a storage tank almost anywhere in the United States based on desired yield and reliability, collection area, and local rainfall statistics. Our methodology could be extended to other regions of world, and the equations presented herein could be used to investigate how RWH systems would respond to changes in climatic variability. The resulting model may also prove useful in regional planning studies to evaluate the net benefits which result from the broad use of RWH to meet water supply requirements. We outline numerous other possible extensions to our work, which when taken together, illustrate the value of our initial generalized SRY model for RWH systems.

"Cultivating empathy is a presumed benefit of mindfulness, but this possibility has rarely been investigated experimentally. We examined whether a five-minute mindfulness exercise would cultivate empathy relative to two equally brief control exercises: relaxation and mind-wandering. We further examined whether mindfulness would be especially beneficial for people with autistic or narcissistic traits. Results showed no effect of mindfulness relative to both control conditions on mind reading, empathic responding, or prosocial behavior. Mindfulness effects were independent of autistic traits. Unexpectedly, people higher in autistic traits did show increased prosocial behavior across conditions. Intriguingly, mindfulness improved mind reading in non-narcissistic people, but reduced it in narcissistic people. These findings question whether a brief mindfulness exercise is sufficient for building empathy.

"Neutral beam injection (NBI) is a high-power auxiliary heating system for the EAST device. We present a thermal shield (TS) structure to protect the neck pipe of the EAST equatorial port to avoid damage from the NBI beam. Since the EAST port has a big trumpet structure, a straight section, and a small trumpet structure, to accommodate the port structure, a TS concept is put forward including its cooling system. The cooling loops and the sub-branches were designed with interfaces between the inner cooling branches. The heat removal capability is verified by a thermal hydraulics analysis based on ANSYS code. In particular, fabrication is addressed with technical processing technology, especially for the embedded cooling pipes in the heat sinks. The pipes are checked for leaks after bending and the embedding processing. The assembly activities are demonstrated in the spatial space zones of the port before the engineering installation. It is confirmed that the TS structure is safe and will run feasibly in the EAST discharge. It is indicated that the TS structure can provide thermal shielding and remove heat for the NBI device in the port region.

"In Web 2.0 environment, the influence of customers' voices is increasing. Many companies have built their online brand communities for listening to the diverse voices of the customer (VOC) and promoting customer's engagement. The information obtained from these brand communities is exploited for organizational innovation. However, the VOC with negative contents could possibly present threats to a firm in an online context. In this study, we develop a research model that includes the types of customer expectations, opinion leader engagement, negative valence of VOC, interaction, and innovation. Subsequently, we empirically validate the effects of customer expectations on the interactions among community members and organizational innovation by using a dataset from MyStarbucksIdea.com. The results show that the effects of VOC on the interaction within a brand community and organizational innovation are different depending on the types of expectation in the VOC. Opinion leaders' engagement positively affects the interaction among community members. Moreover, the negative valence of VOC affects the relationships between customer expectations and interactions, and results in a possible threat within an online brand community. The research results give some insight into managing the brand community and analyzing the VOCs so as to achieve organizational innovation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

"Astrocytes and apolipoprotein E (apoE) play critical roles in cognitive function, not only under physiological conditions but also in some pathological situations, particularly in the pathological progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The regulatory mechanisms underlying the effect of apoE, derived from astrocytes, on cognitive deficits during AD pathology development are unclear. In this study, we generated amyloid precursor protein/ apoE knockout (APP/apoE(KO)) and APP/glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-apoE(KO) mice (the AD mice model used in this study was based on the APP-familial Alzheimer disease overexpression) to investigate the role of apoE, derived from astrocytes, in AD pathology and cognitive function. To explore the mechanism, we investigated the amyloidogenic process related transforming growth factor beta/mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (TGF-beta/Smad2/STAT3) signaling pathway and further confirmed by administering TGF-beta-overexpression adeno-associated virus (specific to astrocytes) to APP/GFAP-apoEKO mice and TGF-beta-inhibition adeno-associated virus (specific to astrocytes) to APP/WT mice. Whole body deletion of apoE significantly ameliorated the spatial learning and memory impairment, reduced amyloid beta-protein production and inhibited astrogliosis in APP/apoE(KO) mice, as well as specific deletion apoE in astrocytes in APP/GFAP-apoE(KO) mice. Moreover, amyloid beta-protein accumulation was increased due to promotion of amyloidogenesis of APP,and astrogliosis was upregulated by activation of TGF-beta/Smad2/STAT3 signaling. Furthermore, the overexpression of TGF-beta in astrocytes in APP/GFAP-apoE(KO) mice abrogated the effects of apoE knockout. In contrast, repression of TGF-beta in astrocytes of APP/WT mice exerted a therapeutic effect similar to apoE knockout. These data suggested that apoE derived from astrocytes contributes to the risk of AD through TGF-beta/Smad2/STAT3 signaling activation. These findings enhance our understanding of the role of apoE, derived from astrocytes, in AD and suggest it to be a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for AD. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

"In the present article we report europium-doped strontium ortho-silicates, namely Sr2SiO4:xEu(3+) (x=1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 or 3.0mol%) phosphors, prepared by solid state reaction method. The crystal structures of the sintered phosphors were consistent with orthorhombic crystallography with a Pmna space group. The chemical compositions of the sintered phosphors were confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Thermoluminescence (TL) kinetic parameters such as activation energy, order of kinetics and frequency factors were calculated by the peak shape method. Orange-red emission originating from the D-5(0)-F-7(J) (J=0, 1, 2, 3) transitions of Eu3+ ions could clearly be observed after samples were excited at 395nm. The combination of these emissions constituted orange-red light as indicated on the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity diagram. Mechanoluminescence (ML) intensity of the prepared phosphor increased linearly with increasing impact velocity of the moving piston that suggests that these phosphors can also be used as sensors to detect the stress of an object. Thus, the present investigation indicates that the piezo-electricity was responsible for producing ML in the prepared phosphor.

"Interface shear strength is a critical property used by engineers to evaluate the appropriateness of products for their specific applications. Internal shear strength is another critical property for composite products such as geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) where the product can shear internally before the interface shear strength is mobilized. Multi-component GCLs are a newer type of GCL consisting of either a polymeric membrane liner laminated to or a membrane coating applied to one of the geotextile carriers. Direct shear testing was performed on multi-component GCLs to assess the internal shear strengths of the coatings and laminates on the geotextile surface of the GCL. Direct shear testing was performed on multiple coated and laminated GCLs. Fine-grained sand was used as the interface against the GCL to simulate typical field conditions for these products. The testing was performed in accordance with typical parameters from ASTM D6243-09 using two different loading conditions. The direct shear testing protocol, test results, and observations from the tests performed are discussed.

"We consider the L-2-contraction up to a shift for viscous shocks of scalar viscous conservation laws with strictly convex fluxes in one space dimension. In the case of a flux which is a small perturbation of the quadratic Burgers flux, we show that any viscous shock induces a contraction in L-2, up to a shift. That is, the L-2 norm of the difference of any solution of the viscous conservation law, with an appropriate shift of the shock wave, does not increase in time. If, in addition, the difference between the initial value of the solution and the shock wave is also bounded in L-1, the L-2 norm of the difference converges at the optimal rate t(-1/4). Both results do not involve any smallness condition on the initial value, nor on the size of the shock. In this context of small perturbations of the quadratic Burgers flux, the result improves the Choi and Vasseur's result in [7]. However, we show that the L-2-contraction up to a shift does not hold for every convex flux. We construct a smooth strictly convex flux, for which the L-2-contraction does not hold any more even along any Lipschitz shift. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

"Background-The effects of lifestyle risk factors considered collectively on the human metabolism are to date unknown. We aim to investigate the association of these risk factors with metabolites and their changes during 4 years. Methods and Results-One hundred and sixty-three metabolites were measured in serum samples with the AbsoluteIDQ kit p150 (Biocrates) following a targeted metabolomics approach, in a population-based cohort of 1030 individuals, aged 45 to 83 years at baseline. We evaluated associations between metabolite concentrations (28 acylcarnitines, 14 amino acids, 9 lysophosphocholines, 72 phosphocholines, 10 sphingomyelins and sum of hexoses) and 5 lifestyle risk factors (body mass index [BMI], alcohol consumption, smoking, diet, and exercise). Multilevel or simple linear regression modeling adjusted for relevant covariates was used for the evaluation of cross-sectional or longitudinal associations, respectively; multiple testing correction was based on false discovery rate. BMI, alcohol consumption, and smoking were associated with lipid metabolism (reduced lyso-and acyl-alkyl-phosphatidylcholines and increased diacylphosphatidylcholines concentrations). Smoking showed positive associations with acylcarnitines, and BMI correlated inversely with nonessential amino acids. Fewer metabolites showed relative changes that were associated with baseline risk factors: increases in 5 different acyl-alkyl phosphatidylcholines were associated with lower alcohol consumption and BMI and with a healthier diet. Increased levels of tyrosine were associated with BMI. Sex-specific effects of smoking and BMI were found specifically related to acylcarnitine metabolism: in women higher BMI and in men more pack-years were associated with increases in acylcarnitines. Conclusions-This study showed sex-specific effects of lifestyle risks factors on human metabolism and highlighted their long-term metabolic consequences.

"For more than two centuries, solutions of differential equations have been obtained either analytically or numerically based on typically well-behaved forcing and boundary conditions for well-posed problems. We are changing this paradigm in a fundamental way by establishing an interface between probabilistic machine learning and differential equations. We develop data-driven algorithms for general linear equations using Gaussian process priors tailored to the corresponding integro-differential operators. The only observables are scarce noisy multi-fidelity data for the forcing and solution that are not required to reside on the domain boundary. The resulting predictive posterior distributions quantify uncertainty and naturally lead to adaptive solution refinement via active learning. This general framework circumvents the tyranny of numerical discretization as well as the consistency and stability issues of time-integration, and is scalable to high-dimensions.

"Aggressive behavior is assumed to be associated with certain patterns of social information processing. While some theories link aggression to a tendency to interpret ambiguous stimuli as hostile (i.e., enhanced sensitivity to anger), others assume an insufficient ability to perceive emotional expressions, particularly fear. Despite compelling evidence to support both theories, no previous study has directly investigated the predictions made by these two accounts in aggressive populations. The aim of the current study was to test processing patterns for angry and fearful facial expressions in violent offenders (VOs) and healthy controls (CTLs) and their association with self-reported aggression and psychopathy scores. In Experiment 1, we assessed perceptual sensitivity to neutral-emotional (angry, fearful, happy) blends in a task which did not require categorization, but an indication whether the stimulus is neutral or emotional. In Experiment 2, we assessed categorization performance for ambiguous fearful-happy and angry-happy blends. No group differences were revealed in Experiment 1, while Experiment 2 indicated a deficit in the categorization of ambiguous fearful blends in the VO group. Importantly, this deficit was associated with both self-reported psychopathy and aggression in the VO, but not the CTL group. The current study provides evidence for a deficient categorization of fearful expressions and its association with self-reported aggression and psychopathy in VOs, but no support for heightened sensitivity to anger. Furthermore, the current findings indicate that the deficit is tied to categorization but not detection stages of social information processing.

"Background and aims: Smartphones are ubiquitous. As smartphones increased in popularity, researchers realized that people were becoming dependent on their smartphones. The purpose here was to provide a better understanding of the factors related to problematic smartphone use (PSPU). Methods: The participants were 100 undergraduates (25 males, 75 females) whose ages ranged from 18 to 23 (mean age = 20 years). The participants completed questionnaires to assess gender, ethnicity, year in college, father's education level, mother's education level, family income, age, family history of alcoholism, and PSPU. The Family Tree Questionnaire assessed family history of alcoholism. The Mobile Phone Problem Use Scale (MPPUS) and the Adapted Cell Phone Addiction Test (ACPAT) were used to determine the degree of PSPU. Whereas the MPPUS measures tolerance, escape from other problems, withdrawal, craving, and negative life consequences, the ACPAT measures preoccupation (salience), excessive use, neglecting work, anticipation, lack of control, and neglecting social life. Results: Family history of alcoholism and father's education level together explained 26% of the variance in the MPPUS scores and 25% of the variance in the ACPAT scores. The inclusion of mother's education level, ethnicity, family income, age, year in college, and gender did not significantly increase the proportion of variance explained for either MPPUS or ACPAT scores. Discussion and conclusions: Family history of alcoholism and father's education level are good predictors of PSPU. As 74%-75% of the variance in PSPU scale scores was not explained, future studies should aim to explain this variance.

"A great deal of attention in manufacturing engineering has been focused on finishing operations of hard and brittle materials in recent years. This paper reports an experimental work on the analysis of surface roughness and material removal using design of experiment (DOE) method in magnetic abrasive finishing, (MAF) of flat surfaces. Change in surface roughness and material removal were found to increase with an increase in weight percentage of abrasive particles in magnetic abrasive brush, lubricant volume and decrease in working gap. Also, any decrease in the relative size of the abrasive particles vis-a-vis the iron particles would result into an increase of the surface roughness and decrease in material removal. It was observed that the work piece hardness had no considerable effect on the process results. The optimum parameter levels which lead into the best surface finish and highest material removal were also derived from these experimentations. Optimum levels included weight percentage of abrasive particles of 40%, Lubricant volume of 1 ml, working gap of 3 mm, relative size of abrasive particles vis-a-vis the iron particles of 0.22, and work piece hardness of 82-87 HBN. Disk type test pieces were selected from Al 7075 and their two side surfaces were under experiments.

Methods: Formulations were prepared with different amounts of super disintegrating agents and effervescent bases as disintegrant agents. Flowability and compressibility of mixed powders were evaluated. The prepared formulations were tested for hardness, thickness, friability, weight variation, drug content, wetting time, disintegration time, dissolution study, and moisture uptake studies. Results: The compressibility index and angle of repose were in the range of 15.87%-23.43% and 32.93-34.65, respectively. Hardness, thickness, friability, wetting time, and content uniformity of formulations were in the range of 33.7-37.1 N, 3.00-3.81 mm, 0.27%-0.43%, 31-50 s and 96.28%-99.90%, respectively. Disintegration time of the tablets prepared with super disintegrating agents, effervescent bases, and combination of two were in the range of 30-50, more than 60 and 20-36 s, respectively. Conclusions: Mixture of powders and tablets passed all the specified tests. The results showed formulations prepared by super disintegrating agents and super disintegrating agents with effervescent bases had shorter disintegration time compared to formulations with effervescent bases alone.

"The quest for high-performance flexible circuits call for scaling of the minimum feature size in thin-film transistors (TFTs). Although reduced channel lengths can guarantee an improvement in the electrical properties of the devices, proper design rules also play a crucial role to minimize parasitics when designing fast circuits. In this letter, systematic computer-aided design simulations have guided the fabrication of high-performance flexible operational amplifiers (opamps) and logic circuits based on indium-gallium-zinc-oxide TFTs. In particular, the performance improvements due to the use of an additional third metal layer for the interconnections have been estimated for the first time. Encouraged by the simulated enhancements resulting by the decreased parasitic resistances and capacitances, both TFTs and circuits have been realized on a free-standing 50-mu m-thick polymide foil using three metal layers. Despite the thicker layer stack, the TFTs have shown mechanical stability down to 5-mm bending radii. Moreover, the opamps and the logic circuits have yielded improved electrical performance with respect to the architecture with two metal layers: gain-bandwidth-product increased by 16.9%, for the first one, and propagation delay (t(pd)) decreased by 43%, for the latter one.

"Introduction. - Diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG) constitute 10-15% of all brain tumors in the pediatric population; currently prognosis remains poor, with an overall survival of 7-14 months. Recently the indication of DIPG biopsy has been enlarged due to the development of molecular biology and various ongoing clinical and therapeutic trials. Classically a biopsy is performed using a stereotactic frame assisted procedure but the workflow may sometimes be heavy and more complex especially in children. In this study the authors present their experience with frameless robotic-guided biopsy of DIPG in a pediatric population. Patients and methods. - Retrospective study on a series of five consecutive pediatric patients harboring DIPG treated over a 4-year period. All patients underwent frameless robotic-guided biopsy via a transcerebellar approach. Results. - Among the 5 patients studied 3 were male and 2 female with a median age of 8.6 years [range 5 to 13 years]. Clinical presentation included ataxia, hemiparesis and cranial nerve palsy in all patients. MRI imaging of the lesion showed typical DIPG features (3 of them located in the pons) with hypo-intensity on T1 and hyper-intensity signal on T2 sequences and diffuse gadolinium enhancement. The mean procedure time was 56 minutes (range 45 to 67 minutes). No new postoperative neurological deficits were recorded. Histological diagnosis was achieved in all cases as follows: two anaplastic astrocytomas (grade III), two glioblastomas, and one diffuse astrocytoma (grade III). Conclusion. - Frameless robotic assisted biopsy of DIPG in pediatric population is an easier, effective, safe and highly accurate method to achieve diagnosis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

"This paper describes the architecture and functionality of a generic agent that is in charge of handling a given environment in an Ambient Intelligence context, ensuring suitable contextualized and personalized support to the user's actions, adaptivity to the user's peculiarities and to changes over time, and automated management of the environment itself. The architecture is implemented in a multi-agent system, where different types of agents are endowed with different levels of reasoning and learning capabilities. In addition to controlling normal operations of the environment, the system may identify user's needs and goals and activate suitable workflows to satisfy them. Some actions in these workflow involve the execution of semantic services. When a single service is not available for fulfilling a given need, an automatic service composer is used to obtain a suitable combination of services. The architecture has been implemented in a prototypical agent-based system that works in a Smart Home Environment.

"Wealth is associated with differences in people's self-concepts. We propose that these self-concepts should define the types of appeals that are most effective at motivating generosity. Across three field studies, we randomly assigned participants to view an appeal for a charitable organization that emphasized agency (the pursuit of personal goals) or communion (the pursuit of shared goals). When the appeal emphasized agency, wealthier individuals reported greater willingness to give and donated more money to charity. In contrast, when the appeal emphasized communion, less wealthy individuals reported greater willingness to give. These findings could not be explained by relevant demographic characteristics such as age, ethnicity, or gender. This work adds to a growing body of research suggesting that wealth does not inherently result in selfishness or generosity. By tailoring messages to fit with people's self-concepts, it is possible to catalyze giving across the socioeconomic spectrum. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

"Most of the electrical machines design studies found in literature lie on the concept that the design under investigation (and optimization) focuses mainly on the geometrical aspects of the machine and thus takes into account only a certain ferromagnetic material (i.e. iron) for its parts. These studies, give little or no information about the influence of material alternatives on the same (and optimized) design. From a manufacturers' point of view though, this information is crucial especially nowadays that there are a lot of commercially available materials in the market. In this context, this paper presents the results of a research project in the design stage of an energy efficient three phase squirrel cage induction motor (SCIM), by investigating the effects of several soft magnetic materials (adopted for its stator and/or its rotor parts) on multiple quantities of primary concern such as: efficiency, power factor, output torque, losses, weight and cost. After a brief proposed design procedure, a total of twenty-two different materials from recent manufacturers' data were examined. Also, the main electromagnetic analysis was performed through commercial analysis software. Simple ranking methods are also proposed here for different application areas and the results obtained are then thoroughly discussed and commented.

"A fuzzy logic-based modeling approach using the universal soil-loss equation (USLE) along with selection and application of the appropriate coir geotextile (CG) in soil erosion control was attempted in this study. The fuzzy logic model was developed to address issues of soil erosion risk with constant rainfall intensity. Two simple and efficient fuzzy logic soil erosion models were developed, of which one was for predicting soil erosion intensity (fuzzy-soil erosion model, or F-SEM) and the other was for selecting an appropriate CG type for soil erosion control based on types of soil in various combinations of slope angle and length, crop cover, rainfall intensity, and so forth (fuzzy-CG model, or F-CGM). These two models were developed in such a way that the input data requirement was the minimum for model execution. The considered input parameters were the main primary governing factors that influence soil erosion intensity in the USLE platform. F-SEM and F-CGM was compared with actual field data and found to be very closely matching. F-SEM predicts the erosion intensity of an area, and F-CGM can be used in the selection of CGs for erosion control application. (c) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

"We explore the effect of behavioral realism and reciprocal self-disclosure from computer interviewers on the social responses of human users in simulated psychotherapeutic counseling interactions. To investigate this subject, we designed a 3 x 3 factorial between-subjects experiment involving three conditions of behavioral realism: high realism, low realism, and audio-only (displaying no behavior at all) and three conditions of reciprocal self-disclosure: high disclosure, low disclosure, and no disclosure. We measured users' feelings of social presence (Copresence, Social Attraction, and Emotional Credibility), rapport, perception of the quality of users' own responses (Embarrassment and Self-Performance), emotional state (PANAS), perception of an interaction partner (Person Perception), self-reported self-disclosure, speech fluency (Pause Fillers and Incomplete Words), and Verbal Self-Disclosure. We observed some contradictory outcomes in users' subjective reports. However, the results of objective data analysis demonstrated that users disclosed greater Verbal Self-Disclosure (medium level of intimacy) when interacting with computer interviewers that displayed high behavioral realism and high self-disclosure. Users also delivered more fluent speech when interacting with computer interviewers that displayed high behavioral realism. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"Green-city innovation uses industrial and entrepreneurial ecosystems that can reduce environmental and ecological risks and achieve sustainable urban development without degrading urban environments. In a city, entrepreneurship ecosystems include start-ups and supporting networks of coordinating entities which contribute to economies of scale; however, these systems may make a city's green environment worse, by contributing to air or water pollution. Even though there is a widely held perception of an adverse relationship between urban economic performance and urban environmental conditions, green-city development involving clean industries can be a way to attract employees without affecting urban environments negatively. However, there is a dearth of empirical studies that examine how such a green-related innovative entrepreneurial system could become a growth engine of cities. This paper examines whether a greener city can contribute to the economic prosperity of the city. A two-stage econometrics approach is the method applied, using data from 2000 and 2005. This paper contributes to the field by distinguishing concerns about urban environments in green cities from concerns about economic performances related to innovative and entrepreneurial ecosystems.

It is important to select areas of interest for the detection of glaciers bodies and in particular to capture also the part covered with debris, which is an open issue in remote sensing of the glaciers. We use enhancing features with a physical meaning and we provide a coarse segmentation of the image of the Lys glacier belonging to the Monte Rosa district in the Alps.

"The evolution of consumer electronics, telecommunications and computing has empowered ambient intelligence into an emerging field of research bringing new possible solutions to many problems of human life. One of them is the technological assistance of elders who are suffering from a cognitive deficit with the execution of their everyday life activities inside what is called a smart home. To enable this technology, the first challenge to overcome is the recognition of the resident's activities of daily living (ADLs). This problem consists of inferring the minimal set of possible ongoing ADLs using templates (plans) of activities defined in a library. To successfully achieve that goal, we must exploit constraints of different natures (logical, temporal, etc.) in order to reject a maximal number of hypotheses. However, only a minority of works exploited the elementary spatial aspects related to objects and to their relations in the smart environment. In this paper, we propose a novel recognition model exploiting the fundamental qualitative spatial reasoning approach of Egenhofer to discriminate implausible ongoing activities. Furthermore, the model is validated through extensive testing of realistic scenarios based on clinical trials conducted at our laboratory with both normal and impaired subjects.

"Typical spinel ferrites of CoFe2O4 and MnFe2O4 were studied as heterogeneous catalysts of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for the degradation of paracetamol (APAP) in water. The APAP degradation followed a pseudo-first-order kinetics pattern (R-2 >0.95) under conditions tested. In the presence of 0.2 catalyst, APAP with initial concentration of 10 mg/L would be 90.5% and 100% removed in CoFe2O4/PMS and MnFe2O4/PMS system, respectively. Higher catalyst dosage, higher PMS dosage, neutral pH and lower concentration of HA favored APAP degradation in each system. After being recycled for three times, MnFe2O4 and CoFe2O4 could still effectively catalyze PMS to react with APAP, with the removal efficiencies of 100% and 76.1%, respectively. The production of sulfate radical and hydroxyl radical was validated from the scavenging tests, results showed that sulfate radical was the main reactive species responsible for APAP degradation. Plausible mechanisms on the activation processes were proposed based on the radical identification tests and XPS analysis, showing that Mn2+-Mn3+/Fe3+-Fe2+ recycle and Co2+-Co3+/Fe3+-Fe2+ recycle on catalyst were responsible for the radical generation. The results demonstrated that both CoFe2O4 and MnFe2O4 MNPs activated PMS were promising technologies for water pollution caused by pharmaceuticals. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"Background: The sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide, encoded by SLC10A1, was identified as a functional receptor for hepatitis B virus (HBV). The objective of this study was to determine if there was an association of the Ser267Phe variant (rs2296651) with HBV infection status in Moroccan patients. Methods: Using a TaqMan 5' allelic discrimination assay, the Ser267Phe variant was genotyped in 286 chronic hepatitis B patients, 135 individuals with spontaneous clearance from HBV infection and 109 healthy controls negative for hepatitis B serological markers. Results: In this cohort, we detected only wild-type genotype (S267S) in all groups. This polymorphism was not associated with the HBV infection status in Moroccan patients. Conclusions: The S267F variant is absent among Moroccans regardless of chronic HBV infection status.

"As a cantilever failure involves rapid channel widening and delivers a large volume of sediment into the channel, it is important to understand this mechanism from the river engineering point of view. Different types of riverbank failures have been investigated in several previous studies, but these works have limitations in understanding the complex mechanisms of cantilever failure regarding the coupling of fluvial erosion with that failure. Experiments were thus carried out to assess the underlying mechanisms of cantilever failure using three types of cohesive materials classified on the basis of their percentages of silt-clay content. The experiments showed that fluvial erosion of the lower part of cohesive riverbanks progressively undermines the upper part during the initial stage of a cantilever failure. Tension cracks then develop at the upper surface of the cohesive riverbanks and beam failure occurs thereafter. A mathematical model of cantilever failure was also developed. The model uses a triple-grid approach to simulate the behaviour of a cantilever within the framework of fluvial erosion and the cantilever's subsequent failure. The simulated results show good agreement with the experimental results in terms of spatial-averaged bank width and water level along cohesive riverbanks.

"Bearingless permanent magnet synchronous motors (BPMSMs) have been received more and more attention during the past few decades. To realize the high-performance control for rotation and levitation, we will first need to obtain the accurate suspension force model of a BPMSM. In this work, different from conventional suspension force models, a modeling scheme for the suspension force of a BPMSM is presented by taking into account rotor eccentricity with the Maxwell stress tensor modeling scheme. The theoretical value of a suspension force model is compared by the two-dimensional finite element (FE) analysis, and calculation results reveal that the theoretical value closely agree with the FE computed one. Furthermore, the digital control system is devised by taking advantage of TMS320F2812, and a test platform for experiments is then set up. In accordance with the corresponding findings of the experiments, the rotor stabilization with magnetic levitation can be achieved. The results lay a theoretical and experimental foundation for further study of the BPMSM.

"In this paper, we focus on resource conservation in a model of decentralized management of groundwater and rainwater. We show that a conservation policy may have opposite effects on the level of the resource, depending on the outcome of the decentralized management. More precisely, we consider identical farmers who can use two water resources (groundwater and/or rainwater) and we study the symmetric and asymmetric feedback stationary Nash equilibria of the dynamic game. We show that a subsidy on the use of rainwater may increase the level of the aquifer at the symmetric equilibrium, whereas it decreases the level of the aquifer at the asymmetric equilibrium. This suggests that the usual focus on (interior) symmetric equilibria in dynamic games may provide misleading policy implications.

"We present a preliminary examination of a new approach to a long-standing problem in non-Newtonian fluid mechanics. First, we summarize how a general implicit functional relation between stress and rate of strain of a continuum with memory is reduced to the well-known linear differential constitutive relations that account for relaxation and retardation. Then, we show that relaxation and retardation are asymptotically equivalent for small Deborah numbers, whence causal pure relaxation models necessarily correspond to ill-posed pure retardation models. We suggest that this dichotomy could be a possible way to reconcile the discrepancy between the theory of and certain experiments on viscoelastic liquids that are conjectured to exhibit only stress retardation.

"Metabolism cycles daily between the fed and fasted states. The pathways of energy production are reversible and distinct. In the anabolic (fed) state, the liver stores glucose as glycogen, and fatty acid/triglyceride synthesis is active. In the catabolic (fasted) state, the liver becomes a glucose producer, lipogenesis is slowed, and fatty acid oxidation/ketogenesis is activated. The rate-limiting step for the latter is vested in the carnitine/carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) system, and the off/on regulator of this is malonyl CoA. The AMP-induced protein kinase primarily determines the concentration of malonyl CoA. Four other systems have significant influence: two on fatty acid oxidation and two on lipogenesis. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-1alpha., a master regulator of metabolism, induces hepatic gluconeogenesis and fatty acid oxidation in the catabolic phase. Deficiency of stearoyl CoA desaturase, although having no role in gluconeogenesis, powerfully induces fatty acid oxidation and weight loss despite increased food intake in rodents. Major stimulators of lipogenesis are carbohydrate-responsive element binding protein and the Insig system. The malonyl CoA-regulated CPT system has been firmly established in humans. The other systems have not yet been confirmed in humans, but likely are active there as well. Activation of fatty acid oxidation has considerable clinical promise for the treatment of obesity, type 2 diabetes, steatohepatitis, and lipotoxic damage to the heart.

"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disease with a characteristic BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase (TK) fusion protein. Despite the clinical efficacy accomplished by TKIs therapies, disease progression may affect patient response rate to these inhibitors due to a multitude of factors that could lead to development of a mechanism known as multidrug resistance (MDR). 7-Ketocholesterol (7KC) is an oxidized cholesterol derivative that has been extensively reported to cause cell death in a variety of cancer models. In this study, we showed the in vitro efficacy of 7KC against MDR leukemia cell line, Lucena. 7KC treatment induced reduction in cell viability, together with apoptosis-mediated cell death. Moreover, downregulation of MDR protein caused intracellular drug accumulation and 7KC co-incubation with either Daunorubicin or Vincristine reduced cell viability compared to the use of each drug alone. Additionally, quantitative label-free mass spectrometry-based protein quantification showed alteration of different molecular pathways involved in cell cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis and misfolded protein response. Conclusively, this study highlights the effect of 7KC as a sensitizing agent of multi drug resistance CML and elucidates its molecular mechanisms. Significance: CML patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have showed a 5-year estimated overall survival of 89%, with cumulative complete cytogenetic response of 87%. However, development of drug resistance is a common feature of the disease progression. This study aimed at showing the effect of 7KC as a cytotoxic and sensitizing agent of multidrug resistance CML cell lines. The cellular and molecular basis of this compound were elucidated using a comprehensive strategy based on quantitative proteomic and cell biology assays. We showed that 7KC induced cell death and overcomes drug resistance in CML through mechanisms that go beyond the classical MDR1 pathways. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"We develop linear representation theory for bicircular matroids, a chief example being a matroid associated with forests of a graph, and bicircular lift matroids, a chief example being a matroid associated with spanning forests. (These are bias and lift matroids of contrabalanced biased graphs.) The theory is expressed largely in terms of antivoltages (edge labellings that defy Kirchhoff's voltage law) with values in the multiplicative or additive group of the scalar field. We emphasize antivoltages with values in cyclic groups and finite vector spaces since they are crucial for representing the matroids over finite fields; and integer-valued antivoltages with bounded breadth since they are crucial in constructions. We find bounds for the existence of antivoltages and we solve some examples. Other results: The number of antivoltages in an abelian group is a polynomial function of the group order, and the number of integral antivoltages with bounded breadth is a polynomial in the breadth bound. We conclude with an application to complex representation. There are many open questions. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

"Hyperspectral image superresolution is a highly attractive topic in computer vision and has attracted many researchers' attention. However, nearly all the existing methods assume that multiple observations of the same scene are required with the observed low-resolution hyperspectral image. This limits the application of superresolution. In this paper, we propose a new framework to enhance the resolution of hyperspectral images by exploiting the knowledge from natural images: The relationship between low/high-resolution images is the same as that between low/high-resolution hyperspectral images. In the proposed framework, the mapping between low-and high-resolution images can be learned by deep convolutional neural network and be transferred to hyperspectral image by borrowing the idea of transfer learning. In addition, to study the spectral characteristic between low-and high-resolution hyperspectral image, collaborative nonnegative matrix factorization (CNMF) is proposed to enforce collaborations between the low-and high-resolution hyperspectral images, which encourages the estimated solution to extract the same endmembers with low-resolution hyperspectral image. The experimental results on ground based and remote sensing data suggest that the proposed method achieves comparable performance without requiring any auxiliary images of the same scene.

"A series of bearing capacity tests were conducted with an eccentrically (e/B = 0, 1/12, 1/6, 1/3) loaded model surface (D-f/B = 0) and shallow (D-f/B = 0.25) strip footings (B = 80 mm) resting close to reinforced finite sand slopes to investigate ultimate loads, failure surfaces, load-displacement curves, rotation of footing, etc. The experimental set-up used to run the tests consists of a tank, model footing, sand, and a loading mechanism. A single woven geotextile strip sheet was placed horizontally below the footing's base at a depth of half of the footing's width. Ultimate loads decreased with increasing eccentricity. This decrease is due to a combination of eccentricity and slope. The use of geotextile reinforcement increased ultimate loads in comparison with unreinforced cases. Failure surfaces were not symmetrical, primary failure surfaces developed on the eccentricity (slope) side, and secondary failure surfaces developed on the other side. Lengths of failure surfaces decreased with increasing eccentricity. Prior to failure, footings always rotated towards the eccentricity (slope) side a few degrees.

"Motivated by the reopening mechanics of strongly collapsed airways, we study the steady propagation of an air finger through a collapsed oil-filled channel with a single compliant wall. In a previous study using fully compliant elastic tubes, a 'pointed' air finger was found to propagate at high speed and low pressure, which, if clinically accessible, offers the potential for rapid reopening of highly collapsed airways with minimal tissue damage (Heap & Juel Phys. Fluids, vol. 20 (8), 2008, 081702). The mechanism underlying the selection of that pointed finger, however, remained unexplained. In this paper, we identify the required selection mechanism by conducting an experimental study in a simpler geometry: a rigid rectangular Hele-Shaw channel with an elastic top boundary. The constitutive behaviour of this elasto-rigid channel is nonlinear and broadly similar to that of an elastic tube, but unlike the tube, the channel's cross-section adopts self-similar shapes from the undeformed state to the point of first near wall contact. The ensuing simplification of the vessel geometry enables the systematic investigation of the reopening dynamics in terms of increasing initial collapse. We find that for low levels of initial collapse, a single centred symmetric finger propagates in the channel and its shape is set by the tip curvature. As the level of collapse increases, the channel cross-section develops a central region of near opposite wall contact, and the finger shape evolves smoothly towards a 'flat-tipped' finger whose geometry is set by the strong depth gradient near the channel walls. We show that the flat-tipped mode of reopening is analogous to the pointed finger observed in tubes. Its propagation is sustained by the vessel's extreme cross-sectional profile at high collapse, while vessel compliance is necessary to stabilise it. A simple scaling argument based on the dissipated power reveals that this reopening mode is preferred at higher propagation speeds when it becomes favourable to displace the elastic channel wall rather than the viscous fluid.

"Geosynthetics are planar polymeric products, which are used in connection with soil, rock or other soil-like materials to fulfill various functions in geoenvironmental engineering. Geosynthetics are of ever-growing importance in the construction industry.

Two examples of the material problems related to geosynthetics are discussed in detail: the effect of creep on the long-term performance of geocomposite drains and the numerical simulation of the interaction of soil with geogrids. Both issues are of importance for the use of these products in landfill capping systems. The various functions, which geosynthetics may fulfill in the protection of coastal lines, are illustrated by case studies.

"This article explores how people do sympathetic talk in relation to the European refugee crisis. The analysis was grounded in critical discursive psychology and also drew on the concept of affective-discursive practice. Data was retrieved from a phone-in program on Irish national radio over a 6-month period when the refugee crisis debate was at its height. It is shown that speakers deployed elaborate sympathetic repertoires with ease that described their normative emotional response to the plight of the asylum seekers. But these same speakers found it problematic to present explicit, unambiguous, and unconditional calls of inclusive political solidarity with the asylum seekers, advocating increased asylum provision in Ireland. These findings are discussed in light of the hostile affective-discursive environment towards asylum and the common sense understanding that nation-states have the moral right to exclude, which appears to constrain the talk to a position of ambivalent paternalism.

"Protein misfolding and aggregation has been implicated as the cause of more than 20 diseases in humans such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and systemic amyloidosis. Retardation of A beta-42 aggregation is considered as a promising and challenging strategy for developing effective therapeutics against Alzheimer's disease. Herein, we demonstrated the effect of vitamin B12 (VB) on inhibiting amyloid formation by employing ThT fluorescence assay, circular dichroism, ANS fluorescence assay, dynamic light scattering measurements and transmission electron microscopy and cell viability assay. Our results demonstrate that vitamin B12 (VB), inhibits A beta-42 aggregation in a concentration dependent manner. Further VB also provide protection against amyloid induced cytotoxicity in human neuronal cell line. This study points towards a promising strategy to combat A beta-42 aggregation and may have broader implication for targeting other neurological disorders whose distinct hallmark is also amyloid formation.

"Primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) are a group of rare genetic diseases resulting in the impairment of one or more functions of the human immune system. Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is one of the most prevalent PIDs, yet despite extensive genetic analysis, most patients do not have a monogenetic diagnosis. This has led to the theory that CVID must be a polygenetic condition. An alternative theory to a monogenetic or polygenetic underlying cause of CVID is that it is epigenetic phenomena that are causal in the majority of CVID patients. I will briefly discuss epigenetic regulation in B-cell biology and development, current examples of epigenetic diseases causing CVID-like primary antibody deficiencies, and how these observations may guide future investigation into the role of epigenetics in CVID.

Previously reward-associated stimuli are difficult to ignore, automatically drawing our attention even when we know they are no longer beneficial to us. Recent research has suggested that these value-dependent attentional biases affect more than just perception, biasing an individual to act in such a way as to pursue the attended stimulus. Here, I review this evidence and argue for a direct link between attentional biases and shifts in action-related priorities. Given this link, abnormal or otherwise inappropriate rewardrelated attentional biases are hypothesized to contribute to undesired habits and poor economic choices.

"as the deceleration of processor scaling due to Moore's law accelerates research in new types of computing structures, the need arises for rethinking operating systems paradigms. Traditionally, an operating system is a layer between hardware and applications and its primary function is in managing hardware resources and providing a common abstraction to applications. How does this function apply, however, to new types of computing paradigms? Are operating systems even needed for these new structures? This paper revisits operating system functionality for new computing paradigms. The structure of these new computers is uncertain as there are many possibilities such as neuromorphic, bio-inspired, adiabatic, reversible, approximate, quantum, combinations of these and others unforeseen [1]. We do know, however, that whatever these new computers will be, there will be some need to manage their resources, to provide programming support, to partition, scale, and connect them and to deal with (partial) failure, along with other traditional operating system's functionality. There might also be some new functionality, such as creating abstract control loops, reasoning about precision, new ways of reconfiguring, and more. We strongly believe that even if traditional operating systems functionality evolves, that the need for operating systems will remain in the new era of computing.

"Genes that in certain conditions make their carriers altruistic are being identified, and altruism and selfishness have shown to be heritable in man. This raises the possibility that genetic polymorphisms for altruism/selfishness exist in man and other animals. Here we characterize some of the conditions in which genetic polymorphisms may occur. We show for dominant or recessive alleles how the positions of stable equilibria depend on the benefit to the recipient, b, and the cost to the altruist, c, for diploid altruists helping half or full sibs, and haplodiploid altruists helping sisters. Stable polymorphisms always occur close to the Hamilton threshold rb = c. The position of the stable equilibrium moves away 0 or 1 with both increases in c, the cost paid by the altruist, and increasing divergence from the Hamilton threshold, and alleles for selfishness can reach frequencies around 50%. We evaluate quantitative estimates of b, c and r from field studies in the light of these predictions, but the values do not fall in the regions where genetic polymorphisms are expected. Nevertheless, it will be interesting to see as genes for altruism are discovered whether they are accompanied by alternate alleles for selfishness.

"Background: Prenatal detection of congenital malformations gives an opportunity to positively influence prenatal and postnatal management, survival and morbidity, as well as to allow parental choice and psychological preparation. Objective: To examine the available evidence regarding the impact of detection and underdetection of fetal anomalies as well as that of fetal therapy on neonatal outcome, parental psychological wellness and neonatal care organization. Methods: Literature search of PubMed. Results and conclusions: The impact of prenatal diagnosis on neonatal survival and morbidity is dependent upon the type and severity of the anomalies inasmuch as upon the evaluation criteria chosen. We discuss the various pitfalls in the design of trials explaining why only few studies, targeting selected anomalies, have shown improved outcomes associated with prenatal diagnosis of congenital malformations. Fetal therapy applies mainly to conditions that are lethal either in utero or at birth if untreated before birth. It has rarely been evaluated with the highest level of evidence; this may be explained by a poor acceptability of randomization between prenatal intervention and expectancy up until delivery.

"Cellular learning automata (CLA) is a distributed computational model which was introduced in the last decade. This model combines the computational power of the cellular automata with the learning power of the learning automata. Cellular learning automata is composed from a lattice of cells working together to accomplish their computational task; in which each cell is equipped with some learning automata. Wide range of applications utilizes CLA such as image processing, wireless networks, evolutionary computation and cellular networks. However, the only input to this model is a reinforcement signal and so it cannot receive another input such as the state of the environment. In this paper, we introduce a new model of CLA such that each cell receives extra information from the environment in addition to the reinforcement signal. The ability of getting an extra input from the environment increases the computational power and flexibility of the model. We have designed some new algorithms for solving famous problems in pattern recognition and machine learning such as classification, clustering and image segmentation. All of them are based on the proposed CLA. We investigated performance of these algorithms through several computer simulations. Results of the new clustering algorithm shows acceptable performance on various data sets. CLA-based classification algorithm gets average precision 84% on eight data sets in comparison with SVM, KNN and Naive Bayes with average precision 88%, 84% and 75%, respectively. Similar results are obtained for semi-supervised classification based on the proposed CLA. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"As a replacement for mineral materials, geotextiles have been pervasively used in civil engineering so as to provide separation and filtration. This study aims to recycle Kevlar selvages for the preparation of nonwoven geotextiles. The effects of fiber types and manufacturing processing are examined in terms of pore size, water permeability, and shear resistance (bursting strength, and puncture strength). The test results and statistical analyses indicate that a combination of 20 wt% Kevlar fibers, 60 wt% three-dimensional crimped polyester (PET) fibers, and 20 wt% low-melting-point PET (LMPET) fibers creates geotextiles that have a small pore size, good water permeability, and good shear resistance. These geotextiles prevent soil loss, and have greater water permeability and a higher resistance to sharp objects. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-transmitted Flavivirus belonging to the Japanese encephalitis antigenic complex of the Flaviviridae family. It is transmitted primarily by the bite of infected mosquitoes, particularly Culex spp. and Aedes/Ochlerotatus spp., which acquire the virus by feeding on viraemic birds. Humans, horses and other mammals are regarded as incidental or dead-end hosts. In the last decades, an increasing number of cases of WNV infection in horses and humans have been notified in the Mediterranean basin. In Tunisia, human cases of WNV-related meningoencephalitis were detected in 1997, 2003, 2007, 2010, 2011 and 2012. Based on the analysis of climatic and environmental conditions found in the locations where human cases have been reported in 2012, the aim of this study was to identify similar areas in Tunisia potentially at risk of disease occurrence. Data related to 85 neuroinvasive West Nile fever (WNF) human cases were georeferenced and a set of environmental and climatic variables (wetlands and humid areas, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), temperatures and elevation, migratory bird settlements) were used in the analysis. Areas, ecologically similar to those where human cases were detected, were identified using the Mahalanobis distance statistic. A leave-one-out cross-validation was performed to validate the sensitivity of the model, and 78 of 85 points were correctly classified.

"The purpose of this study was to determine the environmental impacts associated with a deep energy efficiency refurbishment using life cycle assessment. A prototypical refurbished model of an office building located in Auckland, New Zealand was used as a case study. The refurbishment included major changes to the building envelope with additional insulation, modified wall-window ratio, solar shading as well as technical replacement of the lighting and HVAC system. The study included identification of environmental hot spots of a deep energy refurbishment, and consideration of the effect of different electricity mixes in New Zealand on the total environmental impact of the refurbished building when compared to the un-refurbished existing building over different operation periods. An environmental payback period was calculated for each impact category. The results of this study indicate that deep energy refurbishment is associated with significant environmental impacts mainly due to the use of energy-intensive construction materials. However, the refurbishment yields net reductions in most impact categories if the building has a longer operational period. The environmental impacts of a building's operation are mainly associated New Zealand's electricity generated from coal. As future scenarios of New Zealand's electricity mix have a reduced share of electricity generated from coal, the environmental benefits of avoided electricity consumption are also reduced. The study concludes that measures to promote energy efficiency refurbishment in office buildings where a significant proportion of the operational energy is provided from renewable energy sources, should be carefully considered because they may not reduce overall environmental impacts.

"As motion sensors are getting light-weighted and low-priced, there is a growing appetite for the accelerometer-based approaches for efficiently monitoring human activities. This paper proposes an original feature selection approach based on the spectral distances between a given signal and an activity model. This new technique is evaluated and compared to existing techniques in literature. This study also investigates the improvement of classification performances brought by the heart rate (HR) data in addition to the accelerometer data. The experimental dataset is composed of both acceleration and HR recordings from eight volunteers performing five ambulation activities. Four wearable sensor units, including an ECG node are employed. The response of the system to three widely used classifiers, the K-nearest neighbors K-NN, the Naive Bayes NB and the decision Tree C4.5 is reported along with the classification rates. The results reached up to 99% of overall recognition accuracy and higher than 98% using a single-sensor acceleration data and the HR data. These results demonstrate that the spectral distances approach can be adopted to accurately classify activities and that the joint processing of acceleration signals together with the HR signals can increase the classification accuracy compared to the case when processing the acceleration signals alone.

"We posit that commercial Wi-Fi-based unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are vulnerable to common and basic security attacks, capable by beginner to intermediate hackers. We do this by demonstrating that the standard ARDiscovery Connection process and the Wi-Fi access point used in the Parrot Bebop UAV are exploitable such that the UAV's ability to fly can be disrupted mid-flight by a remote attacker. We believe that these vulnerabilities are systemic in Wi-Fi-based Parrot UAVs. Our approach observed the normal operation (i.e., ARDiscovery Connection process over Wi-Fi) of the Parrot Bebop UAV. We then used a fuzzing technique to discover that the Parrot Bebop UAV is vulnerable to basic denial of service (DoS) and buffer-overflow attacks during its ARDiscovery Connection process. The exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in catastrophic and immediate disabling of the UAV's rotors mid-flight. Also, we discovered that the Parrot Bebop UAV is vulnerable to a basic ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) Cache Poisoning attack, which can disconnect the primary mobile device user and in most cases cause the UAV to land or return home. Based on the literature and our own penetration testing, we assert that Wi-Fi-based commercial UAVs require a comprehensive security framework that utilizes a defense-in-depth approach. This approach would likely mitigate security risks associated with the three zero-day vulnerabilities described in this paper as well as other vulnerabilities reported in the literature. This framework will be effective for Parrot Wi-Fi-based commercial UAVs and likely others with similar platforms.

"The same selective forces that give rise to rapid inter- and intraspecific divergence in snake venoms can also favor differences in venoms across life-history stages. Ontogenetic changes in venom composition are well known and widespread in snakes but have not been investigated to the level of unambiguously identifying the specific loci involved. The eastern diamondback rattlesnake was previously shown to undergo an ontogenetic shift in venom composition at sexual maturity, and this shift accounted for more venom variation than (geography. To characterize the genetics underlying the ontogenetic venom compositional change in C. adamanteus, we sequenced adult/juvenile pairs of venom-gland transcriptomes from five populations previously shown to have different adult venom compositions. We identified a total of 59 putative toxin transcripts for C. adamanteus, and 12 of these were involved in the ontogenetic change. Three toxins were downregulated, and nine were upregulated in adults relative to juveniles. Adults and juveniles expressed similar total levels of snake-venom metalloproteinases but differed substantially in their featured paralogs, and adults expressed higher levels of Bradykinin-potentiating and C-type natriuretic peptides, nerve growth factor, and specific paralogs of phospholipases A(2) and snake venom serine proteinases. Juvenile venom was more toxic to mice, indicating that the expression differences resulted in a phenotypically, and therefore potentially ecologically, significant difference in venom function. We also showed that adult and juvenile venom-gland transcriptomes for a species with known ontogenetic venom variation were equally effective at individually providing a full characterization of the venom genes of a species but that any particular individual was likely to lack several toxins in their transcriptome. A full characterization of a species' venom-gene complement therefore requires sequencing more than one individual, although the ages of the individuals are unimportant.

"Objective: African Americans experience high rates of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Self-management strategies, such as medication adherence, are key to mitigating negative T2D outcomes. This article addresses a gap in the literature by examining the intersections of drug abuse histories and medication adherence among urban, older African Americans with T2D. Method: In-depth interview data were collected as part of a larger ethnographic study examining the subjective experience of T2D among urban older adults. Two representative focal cases were selected and thematic analysis performed to illustrate how former illicit drug addicts perceive prescription medication usage. Results: Narratives reveal that participants are displeased about having to take prescription drugs and are making lifestyle changes to reduce medication usage and maintain sobriety. Discussion: Previous drug abuse not only complicates medication adherence but is also a significant part of how older African Americans who are former drug users frame their understanding of T2D more broadly.

"Characterised by the increased spread of technology out of workplaces and into public spaces and homes, the so-called third-wave of human-computer interaction has placed greater focus on scenarios that are socially situated, context dependent and not necessarily task oriented. This movement has led to studies investigating how people interact with digital applications in public spaces, but the discussion of intuitive interaction thus far has not been extended to this new realm of user interfaces. Designing for intuitive interaction in public spaces differs from traditional digital applications due to the inherently fluid social nature and often large-scale character of urban interventions. This article discusses the design of interaction for public spaces, based on applications we developed along the years, contrasted to similar endeavours elsewhere. We analyse them through the lens of frameworks for intuitive interactions and derive a series of strategies towards designing for immediate use and high crowd turnaround in urban interventions.

The key design feature involves the adoption of a magnetic gearing structure and acceptance of the memory machine flux-mnemonic concept. Hence, the proposed machine can not only offer a gear-shifting mechanism for torque and speed transmission, but also provide variable gear ratios for torque and speed variation. The electromagnetic design is studied and discussed. The finite-element method is developed with the hysteresis model to verify the validity of the machine design.

"Underwater exploration has become an active research area over the past few decades. The image enhancement is one of the challenges for those computer vision based underwater researches because of the degradation of the images in the underwater environment. The scattering and absorption are the main causes in the underwater environment to make the images decrease their visibility, for example, blurry, low contrast, and reducing visual ranges. To tackle aforementioned problems, this paper presents a novel method for underwater image enhancement inspired by the Retinex framework, which simulates the human visual system. The term Retinex is created by the combinations of Retina and Cortex. The proposed method, namely LAB-MSR, is achieved by modifying the original Retinex algorithm. It utilizes the combination of the bilateral filter and trilateral filter on the three channels of the image in CIELAB color space according to the characteristics of each channel. With real world data, experiments are carried out to demonstrate both the degradation characteristics of the underwater images in different turbidities, and the competitive performance of the proposed method.

"The traditional power control schemes for induction heating device mainly focus on the pulse frequency modulation (PFM) and the pulse density modulation. But they cannot solve the problems of power control, efficiency, and load-adaption well. This paper presents and analyzes the asymmetrical frequency modulation (AFM) control scheme used in the full-bridge series resonant inverter. With the proposed AFM control technique, the output power is controlled by two variables: the operation frequency and the division factor. Better efficiency performance can be achieved in the medium and low output power range when compared with PFM. The principles as well as the zero-voltage switching condition of the AFM are explained and the power losses of switches are analyzed. A control algorithm that schedules the three control modes of AFM is experimentally verified with a digital signal processor based induction heating prototype. The load-adaption, noise and thermal distribution problem of switches are also analyzed.

"Soil salinization is one of the most common land desertification processes that can be found worldwide. It is a certainly severe environment hazard and threatens the stability of ecosystems. As a rapid and inexpensive tool, remote sensing technology combining with the measurements of soil spectra has been widely concerned on identifying and mapping salt effect on lands. However, as effects of the soil moisture often immerge the effects of salt to soil reflectance spectra, soil moisture became a major factor to restrict soil salinity monitoring from soil reflectance. High soil moisture content will lead to failure on soil salinity estimation from soil reflectance data. In this paper, a semianalytical model using an exponent function was developed to estimate soil salt content (SSC) under different moisture levels based on a control laboratory experiment. And the root-mean- square error and mean relative error were 0.799 g/kg and 31.294%, respectively, when the model was applied to estimate SSCs by wet soil reflectance. To sum up, considering both effects of soil moisture and soil salt on soil reflectance, the semianalytical model reduced SSC estimated error. The approach presented in this paper provides a new way of estimating soil salinity from soil spectra under various soil moisture conditions, and it will be a potential application for large-scale SSC mapping.

"Current methods of monitoring insulin in culture are limited to soluble insulin (secretions or lysates) or synthetic gene reporter analyses. We present an insulin-specific cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cell-ELISA) to assess relative intracellular insulin protein content of adherent cultures, normalized to cell density with further immunocytochemical verification of insulin-expressing cells within identical cultures. The protocol was optimized and validated using an insulin-expressing cell line (INS-1) by confirming direct relations between intracellular insulin content and insulin-expressing cell density, in a glucose exposure-dependent manner. Utility was demonstrated by identifying multiple INS-1 clones lowly expressing insulin following lentiviral particle delivery of interference RNA intended to down regulate one of the insulin gene-directed transcription factors, MafA. The cell-ELISA was also applied to monitor insulin content within partially dissociated primary mouse islet cultures. This technique allows for the first time routine analysis of intracellular insulin protein in vitro suitable for investigating islet cell biology by means of multiple parameter screening.

"The European Spallation Source (ESS), currently under construction in Lund, Sweden, will be the world's most powerful source of neutrons. The goal is to deliver neutrons to users in 2019 and reach full power sometime in the middle of the following decade. One of the key issues for ESS is to develop a strategy, along with the proper innovative tools, to efficiently communicate and smoothly collaborate between divisions and groups inside ESS and with its outside collaborators, so-called In-Kind Contributors (IKC). Technical requirements related to the scope to be delivered are among the most important technical information to be exchanged. This information exchange is facilitated by using a commercial requirements management database that is accessible through the web. The physics multidisciplinary needs are linked with the engineering integration through LinacLego, which is a tool that provides all updated lattice data for the accelerator. The lattice information is then gathered and utilized to control the physical positioning of the mechanical engineering components for the accelerator. The precision for this operation is provided by a dedicated mechanical design skeleton in a Computer Aided Design (CAD) environment. Finally, the realization of all these steps is supervised in detail and continuously evaluated. In this way the required ESS machine design can be delivered, both in terms of the engineering and the physics aspects.

"A significant role in kinesiology classes involving students suffering from hearing impairments is played by communication with these students. The aim is to improve their communication skills, encouraging them to use the best mode of communication, creating the opportunities for socialization and for the integration process (games, physical therapy lesson, and others). The role of the teacher is to transmit knowledge to pupils in a specific language. Due to the particularities of the pupils, the verbal communication in class may be accompanied by nonverbal communication, visual and symbols. Expressive didactic communication involves such elements as the teacher's attitude, way of dressing and motor behavior, facial expression, use of certain gestures, symbols or video, as well as use of permanent eye contact with students throughout classes. This research aims at highlighting the types of communication (verbal, nonverbal, visual and symbols) that may significance contribute to an effective communication in kinesiology classes.

"Developing highly active photocatalysts for water treatment is of vital importance. A large-mesopore hierarchical WO3 hydrate photocatalyst with exposed high energy facets was synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method using sodium chloride as structure-directing agent. The forming model of the hierarchical structure was discussed, and photogenerated oxide species were investigated. It is shown that the orthorhombic WO3 center dot 1/3H(2)O photocatalyst is of a hierarchical structure assembled by various 2-dimension nanosheets and that its average pore diameter reaches approximately 33.2 nm. Besides, it could decompose 92% of rhodamine B (Rh B) under visible light irradiation within four hours. The enhanced photocatalytic efficiency is attributed to the exposed high energy (002) crystal facets of hierarchical structure, and to the large mesopores existing between crossed nanosheets which help to charge carriers separation, adsorption of reactants and desorption of product molecules. Furthermore, the catalyst displays an excellent photocatalytic stability, indicating its broad application in water pollution treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"Introduction: Methadone and buprenorphine are maintenance replacement therapies for opioid dependence; they are also used for pain management. Methadone and buprenorphine (to a lesser extent) have seen sharp increases in mortality associated with their use. They have distinct routes of metabolism (mostly cytochrome P450 dependent), and distinct pharmacologic activity of metabolites. As such, metabolism may play a role in differences in their toxicity. Areas covered: This article reviews peer-reviewed literature obtained from PubMed searches and literature referenced within. The review considers first an overview of drug use and mortality over the past decade. It then provides extensive detail on the in vitro and in vivo human metabolism of methadone and buprenorphine. Using both human and experimental animal studies it then presents the pharmacodynamic activity of parent drug and metabolites at the mu-opioid receptor, as P-glycoprotein substrates and plasma/brain concentration ratios, and activity at the hERG K+ channel. Lessons learned from drug interaction studies in humans are then examined in an attempt to bring together the combined information. Expert opinion: The use and misuse of these drugs contributes to the epidemic in opioid-associated mortalities. A better understanding of metabolism-, transport-and co-medication-induced changes will contribute to their safer use.

"Deep models have recently shown improved performance on numerous benchmark tasks in computer vision and machine learning. The availability of huge amount of digital data, possibility of massively parallel computations on graphics processing units and the development of advance optimisation techniques have pushed the limits of the deep learning framework by superseding the performance of state-of-the-art research, in specific the kernel methods. This research proposes a novel connection between the two paradigms of research and shows empirical evidence to emphasise that the knowledge learnt from one domain could be supplemented with the significant properties of the other domain to achieve the best of both the worlds. The proposed hybrid methodology illustrates the advantages of deep architectures for kernel methods by showing significant improvement in the classification performance on benchmark tasks with kernel methods. It is shown empirically that the results achieved are either better or competitive to the leading benchmarks from support vector machines and deep models.

"This paper presents a retrospective study from 2004 to 2014 of FTIR prostate cancer spectroscopy related to tissues and cell biology. Since vibrational spectroscopy is delicately sensitive to the biochemical composition of the sample and variations therein, it is possible to monitor metabolic processes in tissue and cells, and to construct spectral maps based on thousands of collected IR spectra. These reveal information on tissue structure, distribution of cellular components, metabolic activity and the health condition of cells and tissues. In addition, rapid collection, reliable data, a powerful ability to structure elucidation about IR spectroscopy, and the need for a rapid diagnosis of traditional biopsy (subject to sampling and inter-observer) have potentiated infrared as a way for a new type of analysis based on optical examination and being more objective than conventional colour methods.

"Foldable displays represent one of the most attractive next-generation display applications. Therefore, it is critical to analyze the effects of mechanical stress on amorphous InGaZnO (a-IGZO) thin-film-transistors (TFTs) in order to apply them to foldable displays. In foldable display applications, the dynamic mechanical stress tests are designed to be carried out using a bending radius of less than 3 mm. In this paper, dynamic mechanical bending stress tests are performed on a-IGZO TFTs using various bending radii and directions in order to examine the instability characteristics of the TFTs. In addition, the degradation mechanisms are investigated using a technology computer-aided design simulation. As a result, we have demonstrated that it is now possible to establish reliable circuit guidelines for using a-IGZO TFTs in foldable display applications.

"Cutting movements in football (soccer) induce high loads on the anterior cruciate ligament in the knee. The injury risk is affected by the shoe-surface interaction. For the evaluation of different influencing factors of this interaction the TrakTester, a custom-made device, was used. To obtain significant results from testing ACL loading a realistic plantar pressure distribution in the shoe is required. Using the TrakTester several cutting movements were carried out using two different foot models with the resultant plantar pressure analysed with three different systems: The original foot model with Parotec insoles (24 integrated sensors; Paromed GmbH, Markt Neubeuern, Germany), the modified version of this foot model with Pedar-X insoles (99 sensors; novel GmbH, Munich, Germany) and the inflexible model was surveyed with the OpenGo science system (13 sensors, Moticon, Munich, Germany). For the inflexible model distinct angles between the lower leg and the surface were adjusted and the obtained plantar pressure distributions were analyzed. As the first version showed high pressures in the arch region, it was modified to reduce the load in this area. A second inflexible model induced the pressure in the heel and forefoot region. For various angles similar plantar pressure distributions were obtained. Highest pressures were applied on the medial side of the heel and forefoot with minor load in the arch region. This corresponds to literature data investigating cutting movements with subjects. Tests with the inflexible foot model achieved similar and realistic patterns of the plantar pressure distribution for different angles. This is an important precondition to obtain reproducible data for ACL loading during cutting movements. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"In today's data centers supporting Internet-scale computing and input/output (I/O) services, increasinglymore network-intensive applications are deployed on the network as a service. To this end, it is critical for the applications to quickly retrieve requests from the network and send their responses to the network. To facilitate this network function, operating system usually provides an event notification mechanism so that the applications (or the library) know if the network is ready to supply data for them to read or to receive data for them to write. As a widely used and representative notification mechanism, epoll in Linux provides a scalable and high-performance implementation by allowing applications to specifically indicate which connections and what events on them need to be watched. As epoll has been used in some major systems, including key-value (KV) systems, such as Redis and Memcached, and web server systems such as NGINX, we have identified a substantial performance issue in its use. For the sake of efficiency, applications usually use epoll's system calls to inform the kernel exactly of what events they are interested in and always keep the information up-to-date. However, in a system with demanding network traffic, such a rigid maintenance of the information is not necessary and the excess number of system calls for this purpose can substantially degrade the system's performance. In this paper, we use Redis as an example to explore the issue. We propose a strategy of informing the kernel of the interest events in a manner adaptive to the current network load, so that the epoll system calls can be reduced and the events can be efficiently delivered. We have implemented an event-polling library, named as FlexPoll, purely in user-level without modifying any kernel code. Our evaluation on Redis shows that the query throughput can be improved by up to 46.9% on micro-benchmarks, and even up to 67.8% on workloads emulating real-world access patterns. FlexPoll is a generic mechanism thus it can be adopted by other applications in a straightforward manner, such as NGINX and Memcached.

"Objective: Questionnaires are often used to assess the results of nasal septoplasty, but response rates vary widely. The possible bias caused by non-responders was evaluated to determine the validity of questionnaire results. Methods: Post-operative questionnaires employing visual analogue scales for nasal obstruction were mailed to 182 patients. The 62 non-responders (34.1 per cent) were contacted by telephone, 58 (93.5 per cent) of whom were contactable and responded orally to the questionnaire. Results: Non-responders were younger, but no different from responders with regard to gender, smoking habits or allergies. Post-operative visual analogue scale obstruction scores were slightly, but not statistically, higher in non-responders. However, because non-responders' pre-operative scores were lower, obstruction scores improved less than in responders. The main reason for not responding was forgetfulness. Some would have preferred an electronic version of the questionnaire. Conclusion: Although post-operative obstruction scores did not differ between the groups, nasal obstruction scores improved more among responders than non-responders. Thus, low response rates may cause bias.

"The thermal hydraulics of supercritical water under forced-, mixed convection and natural circulation conditions is not fully understood. In order to study the thermal hydraulic behaviour of this fluid under natural circulation conditions a small size, closed experimental loop has been designed and built. The thermal hydraulic phenomenon occurring in the loop can be measured by thermocouples mounted onto the outer surface of the heated tube wall, absolute and differential pressure transducers and a flow meter; moreover, simultaneously can be visualized by neutron radiography techniques. This paper describes the loop itself, the process of the experiment with the measurement techniques, the data acquisition system applied and the results got during the first measurement series. Based on the results of the first measurement series, it was found that the measured part of the steady state characteristic is independent from the system pressure. A slight dependence of steady state characteristic on the inlet temperature can be identified: the higher the inlet temperature the higher the mass flow rate. The total pressure drop and its components seem to be independent from the system pressure but strongly dependent on the inlet temperature due to the influence of bulk-fluid temperature on the relevant thermophysical properties (density and dynamic viscosity). The pressure drop due to acceleration of flow found to be negligible next to the two dominant components, the pressure drop due to frictional resistance and due to gravity, The coupled evaluation of the radiographic images and the thermophysical properties of wafer have shown that the main driving force behind the decrease of the neutron attenuation is the decreasing water density as the bulk-fluid temperature increases. The reverse of this relationship could be exploited during the validation of future Monte Carlo simulations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"Buprenorphine is a partial mu agonist and kappa antagonist which is used for the treatment of pain and opioid addiction. A mixture of buprenorphine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride has been approved for the treatment of opioid dependence. In this study a third order derivative spectrophotometric method based on zero-crossing technique has been used for the simultaneous determination of buprenorphine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride in tablets. The measurements were carried out at wavelengths of 257.8 (zero-crossing point of naloxone hydrochloride) and 252.2 nm (zero-crossing point of buprenorphice hydrochloride) for buprenorphine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride, respectively in the third order derivative spectra obtained in methanol and 0.1 M NaOH (50: 50) as solvent. The method was found to be linear in the range of 20-80 mu g/mL for buprenorphine hydrochloride and 5-20 mu g/mL for naloxone hydrochloride. The within-day and between-day coefficient of variation and error values were less than 2.5% and 1.8%, respectively. The proposed method was successfully used for simultaneous determination of these drugs in pharmaceutical dosage form without any interference from excipients or need to prior separation before analysis.

"Background: There is an increasing recognition of epidemics of primarily tubular-interstitial chronic kidney disease (CKD) clustering in agricultural communities in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Although it is currently unclear whether there is a unified underlying aetiology, these conditions have been collectively termed CKD of undetermined cause (CKDu). CKDu is estimated to have led to the premature deaths of tens to hundreds of thousands of young men and women over the last 2 decades. Thus, there is an urgent need to understand the aetiology and pathophysiology of these condition (s). International comparisons have provided the first steps in understanding many chronic diseases, but such comparisons rely on the availability of standardised tools to estimate disease prevalence. This is a particular problem with CKD, since the disease is asymptomatic until the late stages, and the biases inherent in the methods used to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in population studies are highly variable across populations. Method: We therefore propose a simple standardised protocol to estimate the distribution of GFR in LMIC populations - The Disadvantaged Populations eGFR Epidemiology (DEGREE) Study. This involves the quantification of renal function in a representative adult population-based sample and a requirement for standardisation of serum creatinine measurements, along with storage of samples for future measurements of cystatin C and ascertainment of estimates of body composition, in order to obtain valid comparisons of estimated GFR (eGFR) within and between populations. Discussion: The methodology we present is potentially applicable anywhere, but our particular focus is on disadvantaged populations in LMICs, since these appear to be most susceptible to CKDu. Although the protocol could also be used in specific groups (e.g. occupational groups, thought to be at excess risk of CKDu) the primary aim of the DEGREE project is characterise the population distribution of eGFR in multiple regions so that international comparisons can be performed. It is only with a standardised approach that it will be possible to estimate the scale of, and variation in, impaired kidney function between affected areas. These data should then provide insights into important social, demographic and environmental risk factors for this increasingly recognised disease.

Plateau lake ecosystem in China is very vulnerable and especially sensitive to environmental change and human disturbance, due to its strong closeness, species simplification, oligotrophy and simple food chain. This research focuses on evaluating the quantitative and spatial relationships of land use pattern and water quality of rivers inflowing to Fuxian Lake, Chinas largest deep freshwater lake in plateau. To investigate the influence of spatial variation in land-use structures and topography on rivers water quality, the distributions of land-use types in the lakes drainage basin were obtained from satellite images, and the correlations between land-use types and inflow water quality indicators were examined by applying statistical analysis and spatial analytical function of Geographic Information System. Subarea-level analysis reveals that a land-use type could exert different effects on water quality in plains and mountains, and the effects had a connection with topographic and hydrologic factors, its mixture with other land-use types, weather conditions during field measurements, as well as its scale. In addition, a comparison of correlation coefficient data for buffer regions of different scales indicated that the effect of land-use type on inflow water quality peaked in buffer regions with a radius between 100 and 200 m. On the whole, the regions within 200 m of river banks were the key regions that affected river water quality, and thus the construction and preservation of a riparian buffer zone in these regions can provide considerable protection from the inputs of non-point source pollutants and nutrients, and important function such as water and soil conservation. Based on these, a pollution control zoning was constructed from two key pollution control zones in the north and south, a phosphate rock pollution control zone in the northeast, a water loss and soil erosion control zone in the east, and a tourism pollution control zone in the west. This research also offers valuable insights into how to carry out subarea-level prevention and control of water pollution and regional development, according to natural environment, land use pattern and characteristics of pollution sources in different pollution control zones.

"Purpose of review Although gout is one of the most common forms of inflammatory arthritis, it has been relatively neglected until recently. Despite progress in many areas of pathophysiology and genetics of gout and the development of new urate lowering therapies, there remain a number of unanswered clinical questions. With the resurgence of interest in gout it is important to recognize key aspects of gout management that remain challenging and require further research. Recent findings The unanswered clinical issues outlined in this review are basic aspects of gout management that clinicians treating people with gout face on a daily basis and include when urate lowering therapy should be commenced, the most appropriate target serum urate, use of prophylaxis when starting urate lowering therapy and the most appropriate urate lowering therapy, particularly for those with chronic kidney disease. Summary Some of the issues outlined in this article are the subject of ongoing clinical research and some, such as use of allopurinol in people with chronic kidney impairment, may be less relevant with the advent of potentially safer urate lowering therapies but until that time further understanding to aid clinical decision-making is required.

"People use at least two strategies to solve the challenge of understanding another person's mind: inferring that person's perspective by reading his or her behavior (theorization) and getting that person's perspective by experiencing his or her situation (simulation). The five experiments reported here demonstrate a strong tendency for people to underestimate the value of simulation. Predictors estimated a stranger's emotional reactions toward 50 pictures. They could either infer the stranger's perspective by reading his or her facial expressions or simulate the stranger's perspective by watching the pictures he or she viewed. Predictors were substantially more accurate when they got perspective through simulation, but overestimated the accuracy they had achieved by inferring perspective. Predictors' miscalibrated confidence stemmed from overestimating the information revealed through facial expressions and underestimating the similarity in people's reactions to a given situation. People seem to underappreciate a useful strategy for understanding the minds of others, even after they gain firsthand experience with both strategies.

"Infrahumanisation studies have shown that people use the ability to experience secondary emotions, compared to primary emotions, as a characteristic that discriminates outgroups. This result has been widely supported in an extensive range of research work. However, we still do not know if under certain conditions this tendency is mitigated. The aim of this study is twofold. On the one hand, to determine whether a solidarity intergroup context results in a more human representation of outgroups, and on the other hand to verify if infrahumanisation bias is mitigated. For this purpose, three vignettes were elaborated. The first included a description of an outgroup, the German people, emphasising their laboriousness and charm. The second described them taking in refugees from the Balkan War. Finally, a text dealing with solidarity in general, without specific reference to the German people, was presented. In a two-step experimental design, first participants had to attribute secondary and primary emotions to the outgroup, and then answer a lexical decision task that registered the strength of association of secondary emotions with the ingroup and outgroup. The results show that the vignettes of intergroup solidarity contribute to humanising the representation of the outgroup and to reduce infrahumanisation bias.

"A division-summation (D-Sigma) digital control for three-phase inverters to achieve active and reactive power injection has been presented. It can overcome the limitation of abc to dq frame transformation. However, the D-Sigma control requires four sets of control laws to cover four quadrant operations, namely, grid connection (power factor (PF) 1 similar to +/- 0.866), rectification with PF correction, PF leading (0 similar to 0.866), and PF lagging (0 similar to-0.866). Moreover, the switching sequences for the four modes are also different from each other, increasing complexity of firmware programming. In this paper, improvement of the control law derivation and region selection for the D-Sigma digital control is presented. By selecting the zero-crossing points of phase voltages as region transitions, the control laws and the related parameter tables for the four modes can be unified to a general form. The switching sequences of the four modes are also unified to the switching pattern of the grid-connectionmode. Additionally, a D-Sigma transformation matrix is identified to simplify the derivation procedure of the division (D) and summation (Sigma), which can obtain the control law directly. Measured results from a 10-kVA 3 phi bidirectional inverter have been presented to confirm the improvement.

"Mucous flow in a tracheal lumen is generated by the beat motion of ciliated cells to provide a clearance function by discharging harmful dust particles and viruses. Due to its physiological importance, the cilia-generated flow and the rheological properties of mucus have been investigated intensively. The effects of viscosity on the cilia-generated flow, however, have not been fully clarified. In this study, we measured bulk background velocity of ciliary flow using a micro particle tracking velocimetry method under various viscosity conditions in mice. The results showed that the flow velocity decreased as the increase with viscosity of ambient fluid. Moreover, no previous study has clarified the pump power generated by cilia, which provides important information with regard to understanding the molecular motor properties of cilia. Measurements of both the ciliary flow and the ciliary motion were conducted to determine the cilia pump power. Our results indicated that the cilia pump during the effective stroke did not drive the ciliary flow efficiently under high viscosity conditions; these findings are necessary to resolve the clearance function.

"In human interaction and communication, not only verbal messages but also nonverbal behavior such as nodding and paralanguage are rhythmically related and mutually synchronized among speakers. This synchrony of embodied rhythms unconsciously enhances a sense of unification and causes an interaction-activated communication in which nonverbal behaviors such as body movements and speech activity increase, and the embodied interaction is activated. In this paper, we propose the concept of an estimation model of interaction-activated communication based on the heat conduction equation with the characteristics of precipitous speed fluctuation and develop a model that estimates the degree of interaction-activated communication by using speech input only. Further, we evaluate the developed model in estimating the period of the interaction-activated communication in an avatar-mediated communication. The results demonstrate that the developed model is effective in estimating the interaction-activated communication.

"Lateral segregation of plasma membrane lipids is a generally accepted phenomenon. Lateral lipid microdomains of specific composition, structure and biological functions are established as a result of simultaneous action of several competing mechanisms which contribute to membrane organization. Various lines of evidence support the conclusion that among those mechanisms, the membrane potential plays significant and to some extent unique role. Above all, clear differences in the microdomain structure as revealed by fluorescence microscopy could be recognized between polarized and depolarized membranes. In addition, recent fluorescence spectroscopy experiments reported depolarization-induced changes in a membrane lipid order. In the context of earlier findings showing that plasma membranes of depolarized cells are less susceptible to detergents and the cells less sensitive to antibiotics or antimycotics treatment we discuss a model, in which membrane potential driven re-organization of the microdomain structure contributes to maintaining membrane integrity during response to stress, pathogen attack and other challenges involving partial depolarization of the plasma membrane.

"Objective: Psychiatric symptoms of varying degrees that accompany hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) may continue throughout the pregnancy or after, and these psychological problems may cause morbidity. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between the HG and psychiatric symptoms in the first trimester and postpartum depression. Methods: Two hundred and seven pregnant who were diagnosed as HG and 177 healthy pregnant women included in this prospective study. All cases were assessed with SCL-90-R in first trimester and with ED in postpartum period. Factors related to postpartum psychiatric symptoms were investigated with bivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: SCL-90-R and ED scores were statistically significant at HG group (p<0.05). In cases who diagnosed as postpartum depression, the rates of HG and SCL-90-R results were higher (p<0.05). In the bivariate analysis, the high rates of HG and high SCL-90-R scores were determined to be related to postpartum depression (p<0.05). Conclusions: The results show that mental health is negatively affected by HG at pregnancy, and in this case, psychiatric symptoms may continue even after discontinuation HG.

"Bifidobacteria exert beneficial effects on hosts and are extensively used as probiotics. However, due to the genetic inaccessibility of these bacteria, little is known about their mechanisms of carbohydrate utilization and regulation. Bifidobacterium breve strain JCM1192 can grow on water-insoluble yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cell wall glucans (YCWG), which were recently considered as potential prebiotics. According to the results of H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry, the YCWG were composed of highly branched (1 ->3,1 ->6)-beta-glucans and (1 ->4,1 ->6)-alpha-glucans. Although the YCWG were composed of 78.3% beta-glucans and 21.7% alpha-glucans, only alpha-glucans were consumed by the B. breve strain. The ABC transporter (malEFG1) and pullulanase (aapA) genes were transcriptionally upregulated in the metabolism of insoluble yeast glucans, suggesting their potential involvement in the process. A nonsense mutation identified in the gene encoding an ABC transporter ATP-binding protein (MalK) led to growth failure of an ethyl methanesulfonate-generated mutant with yeast glucans. Coculture of the wild-type strain and the mutant showed that this protein was responsible for the import of yeast glucans or their breakdown products, rather than the export of alpha-glucancatabolizing enzymes. Further characterization of the carbohydrate utilization of the mutant and three of its revertants indicated that this mutation was pleiotropic: the mutant could not grow with maltose, glycogen, dextrin, raffinose, cellobiose, melibiose, or turanose. We propose that insoluble yeast alpha-glucans are hydrolyzed by extracellular pullulanase into maltose and/or maltooligosaccharides, which are then transported into the cell by the ABC transport system composed of MalEFG1 and MalK. The mechanism elucidated here will facilitate the development of B. breve and water-insoluble yeast glucans as novel synbiotics. IMPORTANCE In general, Bifidobacterium strains are genetically intractable. Coupling classic forward genetics with next-generation sequencing, here we identified an ABC transporter ATP-binding protein (MalK) responsible for the import of insoluble yeast glucan breakdown products by B. breve JCM1192. We demonstrated the pleiotropic effects of the ABC transporter ATP-binding protein in maltose/maltooligosaccharide, raffinose, cellobiose, melibiose, and turanose transport. With the addition of transcriptional analysis, we propose that insoluble yeast glucans are broken down by extracellular pullulanase into maltose and/or maltooligosaccharides, which are then transported into the cell by the ABC transport system composed of MalEFG1 and MalK. The mechanism elucidated here will facilitate the development of B. breve and water-insoluble yeast glucans as novel synbiotics.

"It is important to establish the forecasting model of the network security situation. But the network security situation cannot be observed directly and can only be measured by other observable data. In this paper the network security situation is considered as a hidden behavior. In order to predict the hidden behavior, some methods have been proposed. However, these methods cannot use the hybrid information that includes qualitative knowledge and quantitative data. As such, a forecasting model of network security situation is proposed on the basis of the hidden belief rule base (BRB) model when the inputs are multidimensional. The initial parameters of the hidden BRB model given by experts may be subjective and inaccurate. In order to train the parameters, a revised covariance matrix adaption evolution strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm is further developed by adding a modified operator. The revised CMA-ES algorithm can optimize the parameters of the hidden BRB model effectively. The case study shows that compared with other methods, the proposed hidden BRB model and the revised CMA-ES algorithm can predict the network security situation effectively to improve the forecasting precision by making full use of qualitative knowledge.

"To combine the complementary strengths of human vision (HV) and computer vision (CV) in target image retrieval, we proposed a brain-computer interface framework, Bayesian HV-CV Retrieval (BHCR), which couples HV with CV by a Bayesian method to retrieve target images in rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) sequences. To construct a well-suited electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding module for BHCR, we conducted a comparative inspection on the selection of classification algorithms, and adopted linear discriminant analysis and random forests as a feature extraction method and classification algorithm, respectively. We also introduced a CV system based on convolutional neural network (CNN) as a component of BHCR. A Bayesian brain-computer interaction (BBC') module was carefully designed so that for each presented image, a Bayesian model that takes HV insight as prior information and CV insights as sample information is built up to present retrieval results. Unlike existing HV-CV coupled works that usually require extra manual labor, BHCR directly enhanced retrieval performance with the help of CV insights. As an auxiliary work and a natural extension of BHCR, we then proposed a probability propagation scheme that incorporates EEG decoding insights to improve the CV system and a one-shot image database retrieval scheme. We demonstrated the effectiveness of BHCR by extensive experiments and simulations on both the entire framework and its sub-components. The results showed the following: (1) The performance of BHCR was significantly better than the EEG-only mechanism in both receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and classification aspects; (2) The robustness of BHCR was ensured by its process flow and the steady performances of its sub-components.

"Robust and efficient target-tracking algorithms embedded on moving platforms, are a requirement for many computer vision and robotic applications. However, deployment of a real-time system is challenging, even with the computational power of modern hardware. As inspiration, we look to biological lightweight solutions-lightweight and low-powered flying insects. For example, dragonflies pursue prey and mates within cluttered, natural environments, deftly selecting their target amidst swarms. In our laboratory, we study the physiology and morphology of dragonfly 'small target motion detector' neurons likely to underlie this pursuit behaviour. Here we describe our insect-inspired tracking model derived from these data and compare its efficacy and efficiency with state-of-the-art engineering models. For model inputs, we use both publicly available video sequences, as well as our own task-specific dataset (small targets embedded within natural scenes). In the context of the tracking problem, we describe differences in object statistics within the video sequences. For the general dataset, our model often locks on to small components of larger objects, tracking these moving features. When input imagery includes small moving targets, for which our highly nonlinear filtering is matched, the robustness outperforms state-of-the-art trackers. In all scenarios, our insect-inspired tracker runs at least twice the speed of the comparison algorithms.

"Energy storage is unique in that it can provide multiple services. This feature raises cost-recovery issues for storage, due to the combination of competitive markets and ratebased cost recovery used in many power systems today. This hybrid regulatory paradigm relies on classifying assets as providing competitively prices or unpriced services and handling cost recovery based on that classification. Some recent regulatory precedents suggest that storage developers must choose between classifying their assets as providing competitively priced or unpriced services. In the former case, storage costs must be recovered through the market. If an asset is classified as providing only unpriced services, costs can be recovered through the ratebase. This regulatory design can hamper cost recovery for storage and may lead to inefficient storage investment and use. We propose an alternate solution whereby storage-capacity rights are auctioned to third parties that use their rights for priced or unpriced services. Storage-capacity rights disentangle storage cost recovery from the regulatory treatment of its end use. We formulate the storage-capacity auction model and demonstrate how to efficiently price storage-capacity rights. We show that the revenues earned by the storage owner through the auction equals the imputed marginal value of storage capacity, as revealed by the market bids.

"Release and transport of leachate from municipal solid waste landfills pose a potential hazard to both surrounding ecosystems and human populations. In the present study, soil, groundwater, and surface water samples were collected from the periphery of a municipal solid waste landfill (located at Ranital of Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, India) for laboratory analysis to understand the release of contaminants. The landfill does not receive any solid wastes for dumping now as the same is under a landfill closure plan. Groundwater and soil samples were collected from the bore holes of 15 m deep drilled along the periphery of the landfill and the surface water samples were collected from the existing surface water courses near the landfill. The landfill had neither any bottom liner nor any leachate collection and treatment system. Thus the leachate generated from the landfills finds paths into the groundwater and surrounding surface water courses. Concentrations of various physico-chemical parameters including some toxic metals (in collected groundwater, soil, and surface water samples) and microbiological parameters (in surface water samples) were determined. The analyzed data were integrated into ArcGIS environment and the spatial distribution of the metals and other physic-chemical parameter across the landfill was extrapolated to observe the distribution. The statistical analysis and spatial variations indicated the leaching of metals from the landfill to the groundwater aquifer system. The study will help the readers and the municipal engineers to understand the release of contaminants from landfills for better management of municipal solid wastes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"A modeling approach based on domain partitioning and use of the electromagnetic circuit formulation for full wave electromagnetic field is applied for high frequency integrated passive components, including MEMS switches. The procedure is completed by model order reduction and generation of a small compact model that describes with high accuracy the input-output behavior of the device. The main benefit of the approach is that it allows the saving of computational resources, that will be further used to refine the most complicated part of the domain, and thus obtain a more accurate model for the full device. The procedure is validated for real benchmarks for which measurements are available, as well as for a RF MEMS switch test, described in the literature.

"Despite decades of research with humans, the biological mechanisms that motivate an individual to help others remain poorly understood. In order to investigate the roots of pro-sociality in mammals, we established the helping behavior test, a paradigm in which rats are faced with a conspecific trapped in a restrainer that can only be opened from the outside. Over the course of repeated test sessions, rats exposed to a trapped cagemate learn to open the door to the restrainer, thereby helping the trapped rat to escape (Ben-Ami Bartal et al., 2011). The discovery of this natural behavior provides a unique opportunity to probe the motivation of rodent helping behavior, leading to a deeper understanding of biological influences on human pro-sociality. To determine if an affective response motivates door-opening, rats receiving midazolam, a benzodiazepine anxiolytic, were tested in the helping behavior test. Midazolam-treated rats showed less helping behavior than saline-treated rats or rats receiving no injection. Yet, midazolam-treated rats opened a restrainer containing chocolate, highlighting the socially specific effects of the anxiolytic. To determine if midazolam interferes with helping through a sympatholytic effect, the peripherally restricted beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist nadolol was administered; nadolol did not interfere with helping. The corticosterone response of rats exposed to a trapped cagemate was measured and compared to the rats' subsequent helping behavior. Rats with the greatest corticosterone responses showed the least helping behavior and those with the smallest responses showed the most consistent helping at the shortest latency. These results are discussed in terms of their implications for the interaction between stress and pro-social behavior. Finally, we observed that door-opening appeared to be reinforcing. A novel analytical tool was designed to interrogate the pattern of door-opening for signs that a rat's behavior on one session influenced his behavior on the next session. Results suggest that helping a trapped rat has a greater motivational value than does chocolate. In sum, this series of experiments clearly demonstrates the fundamental role of affect in motivating pro-social behavior in rodents and the need for a helper to resonate with the affect of a victim.

"This paper investigates the reduction of dynamic power for streaming applications yielded by asynchronous dataflow designs by using clock gating techniques. Streaming applications constitute a very broad class of computing algorithms in areas such as signal processing, digital media coding, cryptography, video analytics, network routing, packet processing, etc. This paper introduces a set of techniques that, considering the dynamic streaming behavior of algorithms, can achieve power savings by selectively switching off parts of the circuits when they are temporarily inactive. The techniques being independent from the semantic of the application can be applied to any application and can be integrated into the synthesis stage of a high-level dataflow design flow. Experimental results of at-size applications synthesized on field-programmable gate arrays platforms demonstrate power reductions achievable with no loss in data throughput.

"Intrachromosomal triplications are complex chromosomal rearrangements which arise during meiosis or mitosis and lead to a tetrasomic dose of the affected genomic regions. We describe a female patient harboring an intrachromosomal triplication who presented to the Genetics clinic with dysmorphic features, including telecanthus, flat facial profile, and prognathism, short stature, widely spaced nipples, multiple allergy complaints, loose bowel movements, and mild speech delay. Microarray analysis showed a copy number gain of a 22.37 Mb region of chromosome 11 between bands 11q14.1 and 11q22.1. This region contains 95 genes and seven microRNAs, none of which have been implicated in a disease resulting from increased gene dosage. FISH analysis using a probe targeted to the middle of the segment of the copy number gain yielded a pattern indicative of a tetrasomy via an intrachromosomal triplication, with three signals on the long arm of one homologue of chromosome 11 and the fourth on the other homologue. Subsequent FISH analysis showed that the middle triplicated fragment was positioned in an inverted orientation relative to the outer fragments. To investigate the mechanism by which the intrachromosomal triplication occurred, SNP microarray analysis was performed. These results were consistent with the presence of multiple haplotypes in the tetrasomic region and suggest that the intrachromosomal triplication in our patient arose in one parent during meiosis.

"Background-Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a genetically heterogeneous condition caused by mutations in genes encoding desmosomal proteins in up to 60% of cases. The 40% of genotype-negative cases point to the need of identifying novel genetic substrates by studying genotype-negative ARVC families. Methods and Results-Whole exome sequencing was performed on 2 cousins with ARVC. Validation of 13 heterozygous variants that survived internal quality and frequency filters was performed by Sanger sequencing. These variants were also genotyped in all family members to establish genotype-phenotype cosegregation. High-resolution melting analysis followed by Sanger sequencing was used to screen for mutations in cadherin 2 (CDH2) gene in unrelated genotype-negative patients with ARVC. In a 3-generation family, we identified by whole exome sequencing a novel mutation in CDH2 (c.686A>C, p.Gln229Pro) that cosegregated with ARVC in affected family members. The CDH2 c.686A>C variant was not present in >200000 chromosomes available through public databases, which changes a conserved amino acid of cadherin 2 protein and is supported as the causal mutation by parametric linkage analysis. We subsequently screened 73 genotype-negative ARVC probands tested previously for mutations in known ARVC genes and found an additional likely pathogenic variant in CDH2 (c.1219G>A, p.Asp407Asn). CDH2 encodes cadherin 2 (also known as N-cadherin), a protein that plays a vital role in cell adhesion, making it a biologically plausible candidate gene in ARVC pathogenesis. Conclusions-These data implicate CDH2 mutations as novel genetic causes of ARVC and contribute to a more complete identification of disease genes involved in cardiomyopathy.

"Many hospitality consumption experiences are shared with fellow consumers such as acquaintances, friends, or family members. Yet research examining the impact of fellow consumers' presence on consumers' donation behaviors is scant. To bridge that gap, the current research examines how the presence of fellow consumers influences consumers' donation behaviors in a restaurant setting. Results from our experiment reveal that the impact of fellow consumers' presence depends on two factors: observability of the donation and donation appeal type. Specifically, we found that when the act of donating is unobservable by others and the donation appeal highlights self-benefits, the presence of fellow consumers drives individuals to exhibit more favorable attitude and higher levels of donation intention. Conversely, when the act of donation is observable by others and the donation appeal portrays other benefits, the presence of fellow consumers makes individuals to exhibit less favorable attitude and lower levels of donation intention. Furthermore, our mediation analyses show that anticipated emotional benefits is the underlying psychological mechanism explaining the effects. We discuss the theoretical contributions and managerial implications of our findings as well as limitations and opportunities for future research.

"The semiconductor industry demands for pumps which handle aggressive fluids at very high temperatures, as this is an important step towards higher process speeds and increased yield in semiconductor etching applications. This paper presents the thermal, electrical and mechanical design of a bearingless pump for operating temperatures of up to 250 degrees C without active cooling. A detailed thermal analysis of the machine is presented which allows for the prediction of the thermal stress of critical components. The machine design is based on the prediction of the internal temperatures and hydraulic specifications of the pump. Furthermore, a hallsensorless, observer-based, control of the rotor angle is presented. The necessity for this control scheme arises from the high temperatures that prevent the usage of conventional angle measurement systems.

"The clinical implementation of a new carbon-fiber-reinforced polyetheretherketon (PEEK) plate for distal radius fractures might offer advantageous properties over the conventional metallic devices. This includes similar elastic modulus to cortical bone, radiolucency, low artifacts on MRI scans and the lack of metal allergies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical results at 6-week and 12-month follow-up using either a new fixed angle (monoaxial) PEEK plate system or a fixed angle (polyaxial) titanium plate. We included 26 patients (mean age 59.3) with displaced fractures of the distal radius (all AO types). Radiological and functional outcomes were measured prospectively at a 6-week and 12 month follow-up. We documented no cases of hardware breakage or significant loss of the surgically achieved fracture reduction with the usage oft the new PEEK device. Operating time was 101.0 min using PEEK versus 109.3 min in titanium plates, recorded times were including preparation, draping, and postoperative processing (ns, p 0.156). At the 6-week follow up the PEEK plate showed a trend for better range of motion and functional results (DASH-score, Mayo-wrist score, VAS) with no statistical significance. Results of 12 month follow up with PEEK showed comparable results with corresponding studies examining titanium plate after this period. First experience with PEEK plate osteosynthesis demonstrate quick clinical implementation with good clinical outcome and the advantage of excellent postoperative radiological assessment. At early follow-up PEEK even showed a trend for improved functional results.

"Experiments conducted to quantify potential leakage from holes in two geomembranes [1-mm-thick linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) and 2-mm-thick high-density polyethylene (HDPE)] placed on a silty-sand [underliner hydraulic conductivity (kUL), 1.1x10-7kUL1.2x10-5m/s], or pea gravel (kUL=1x10-2m/s) underliner (foundation/subgrade) and covered with saturated fine tailings at 65% initial solids content are discussed [tailings hydraulic conductivity (kT), 2.9x10-8kT1.6x10-6m/s]. Tests results show that the overlying tailings, with a kT<kUL, filled the geomembrane hole and had a larger effect on flow through the hole than the underliners examined. For the tested conditions, leakage through 10 and 20-mm-diameter holes were essentially the same whereas the leakage through a 1.5-mm-diameter hole was three orders of magnitude lower. Introduction of a 580g/m2 nonwoven needle-punched geotextile (GTX) layer between the geomembrane and tailings increased the flow by approximately 60%. A gap below geomembrane hole attributable to a stone on the underliner filled with tailings, which flowed through the hole.

"A social information processing (SIP) theory of parenting risk posits that social-cognitive and neuro-cognitive incapacities characterize at-risk parents, and that these cognitive difficulties operate across relational domains. This study focused on highly disadvantaged mothers of preschoolers and compared mothers with histories of perpetrating child neglect (n = 69) to demographically similar mothers without such histories (n = 76). Participants completed measures of unrealistic expectations for children and other adults, social problem-solving in parenting and nonparenting situations, executive functioning (EF), and attributions for children and other adults. As predicted, associations among these measures were found within and across relational domains. Exploratory factor analysis revealed two distinct clusters that distinguished the two groups. The first included measures of expectations and attributions (for both children and other adults) and the second included problem-solving difficulties and EF. When group differences were examined on individual variables, mothers with histories of perpetrating neglect exhibited more unrealistic expectations of children and other adults, more hostile attributions toward children and other adults, and poorer performance on tests of EF than comparisons. Only interpersonal problem-solving (in both parenting and nonparenting situations) failed to differentiate the neglect group from comparisons. In regression analyses, both parenting and nonparenting social cognition and EF contributed significantly to child neglect. These findings provide some support for this cognitive model of parenting risk and suggest widespread disturbances in parenting and nonparenting social cognition and neurocognition, may play a role in child neglect.

Lactate and acetate were higher than baseline at 1 and 1.5 h. Hypoxanthine and inosine remained above baseline throughout the postexercise period. Urate decreased at 1 h and increased at 1.5 h before returning to baseline. Valine, isoleucine, succinate, citrate, trimethylamine, trimethylamine N-oxide, tyrosine, and formate decreased at 1 h and/or 1.5 h postexercise and then returned to baseline. Creatinine gradually decreased over the sampling period. Glycine, 4-aminohippurate, and hippurate remained below baseline throughout the postexercise period. Our findings show that even one-half minute of maximal exercise elicited major perturbations in human metabolism, several of which persisted for at least 2 h.

"The cross hybrid (XS) concept has been demonstrated experimentally with 3.3-kV Si Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBTs) and SiC MOSFETs in parallel, and used to calibrate 2D Technology Computer Aided Design simulations. The XS hybrid offers lower switching losses compared with full Si IGBTs and reduced oscillations compared with full SiC MOSFETs. The current sharing mechanism between the IGBT and the MOSFET in the XS hybrid has been elucidated, showing that under typical switching conditions, the IGBT dissipate 98% of the XS hybrid turn-OFF losses compared with the SiC MOSFET. Since the current density of the IGBT in the XS hybrid is twice of that of the full IGBT solution, it exhibits higher dynamic avalanche. These features results in stress at device and package level, thereby compromising robustness and reliability. In order to overcome such issues, we show that increasing the turn-OFF gate resistance improves current sharing in the XS hybrid by delaying the turn-OFF of the MOSFET, and thereby suppressing dynamic avalanche in the IGBT.

"Introduction: Molecular tests that were once ancillary to the core business of cyto-histopathology are becoming the most relevant workload in pathology departments after histopathology/cytopathology and before autopsies. This has resulted from innovations in molecular biology techniques, which have developed at an incredibly fast pace.Areas covered: Most of the current widely used techniques in molecular pathology such as FISH, direct sequencing, pyrosequencing, and allele-specific PCR will be replaced by massive parallel sequencing that will not be considered next generation, but rather, will be considered to be current generation sequencing. The pre-analytical steps of molecular techniques such as DNA extraction or sample preparation will be largely automated. Moreover, all the molecular pathology instruments will be part of an integrated workflow that traces the sample from extraction to the analytical steps until the results are reported; these steps will be guided by expert laboratory information systems. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry for quantification will be largely digitalized as much as histology will be mostly digitalized rather than viewed using microscopy.Expert commentary: This review summarizes the technical and regulatory issues concerning the standardization of molecular tests in pathology. A vision of the future perspectives of technological changes is also provided.

"Alya is a multi-physics simulation code developed at Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC). From its inception Alya code is designed using advanced High Performance Computing programming techniques to solve coupled problems on supercomputers efficiently. The target domain is engineering, with all its particular features: complex geometries and unstructured meshes, coupled multi-physics with exotic coupling schemes and physical models, ill-posed problems, flexibility needs for rapidly including new models, etc. Since its beginnings in 2004, Alya has scaled well in an increasing number of processors when solving single-physics problems such as fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, acoustics, etc. Over time, we have made a concerted effort to maintain and even improve scalability for multi-physics problems. This poses challenges on multiple fronts, including: numerical models, parallel implementation, physical coupling models, algorithms and solution schemes, meshing process, etc. In this paper, we introduce Alya's main features and focus particularly on its solvers. We present Alya's performance up to 100.000 processors in Blue Waters, the NCSA supercomputer with selected multi-physics tests that are representative of the engineering world. The tests are incompressible flow in a human respiratory system, low Mach combustion problem in a kiln furnace, and coupled electro-mechanical contraction of the heart. We show scalability plots for all cases and discuss all aspects of such simulations, including solver convergence. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"This paper presents an integrated maximum power point tracking system for use with a thermophotovoltaic portable power generator. The design, implemented in 0.35-mu m CMOS technology, consists of a low-power control stage and a dc-dc boost power stage with soft-switching capability. With a nominal input voltage of 1 V, and an output voltage of 4 V, we demonstrate a peak conversion efficiency under nominal conditions of over 94% (overall peak efficiency over 95%), at a power level of 300 mW. The control stage uses lossless current sensing together with a custom low-power time-based analogto- digital converter to minimize control losses. The converter employs a fully integrated digital implementation of a peak power-tracking algorithm, and achieves a measured tracking efficiency above 98%. A detailed study of achievable efficiency versus inductor size is also presented, with the calculated and measured results.

"Stem cells have emerged as an important approach to repair and regenerate damaged tissues or organs and show great therapeutic potential in a variety of diseases. However, the low survival of engrafted stem cells still remains a major challenge for stem cell therapy. As a major hormone from the pineal gland, melatonin has been shown to play an important role in regulating the physiological and pathological functions of stem cells, such as promoting proliferation, migration and differentiation. Thus, melatonin combined with stem cell transplantation displayed promising application potential in neurodegenerative diseases, liver cirrhosis, wound healing, myocardial infarction, kidney ischemia injury, osteoporosis, etc. It exerts its physiological and pathological functions through its anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiapoptosis and anti-ageing properties. Here, we summarize recent advances on exploring the biological role of melatonin in stem cells, and discuss its potential applications in stem cell-based therapy. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

"Rolling stock examination is performed to identify the defects during train movements at speeds < 30 kmph. In this study, this process was automated using computer vision models. Parts on a moving train were segmented using four types of active contour-level set models: Chan-Vese (CV), CV-based morphological differential gradient (CV-MDG), CV with shape priors (CV-SP), and CV with shape invariance (CV-SI). CV level sets with shape invariance model enables the adjustment of contour according to scale, rotation, and location of the shape prior object in the rolling stock frame. Train rolling stock video data were captured at a high speed of 240 fps by using a sports action camera with 52 degrees wide angle lenses. The level sets yielded optimal segmentation results compared with traditional segmentation methods. The performance indicators of segmented parts from the proposed four algorithms are structural similarity index measure and peak signal-to-noise ratio (in dB). A total of 10 parts were extracted from a bogie by using the proposed models and compared against the ground truth models to test the performance of the methods. The train had 15 passenger cars with 30 bogies. Furthermore, the models were tested under various lighting conditions for five trains. The CV shape invariance model yielded more efficient segmentations both qualitatively and quantitatively.

"Mutations in the TREM2 gene confer risk for Alzheimer's disease and susceptibility for Parkinson's disease (PD). We evaluated the effect of TREM2 deletion in a 1-methyl 4-phenyl 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model, measuring neurodegeneration and microglia activation using a combined in vivo imaging and postmortem molecular approach. In wild-type mice, MPTP administration induced a progressive decrease of [C-11] FECIT uptake, culminating at day 7. Neuronal loss was accompanied by an increase of TREM2, IL-1 beta, and translocator protein (TSPO) transcript levels, [C-11]PK11195 binding and GFAP staining (from day 2), and an early and transient increase of TNF-alpha, Galectin-3, and Iba-1 (from day 1). In TREM2 null (TREM2(-/-)) mice, MPTP similarly affected neuron viability and microglial cells, as shown by the lower level of Iba-1 staining in basal condition, and reduced increment of Iba-1, TNF-alpha, and IL-1 beta in response to MPTP. Likely to compensate for TREM2 absence, TREM2(-/-) mice showed an earlier increment of [C-11] PK11195 binding and a significant increase of IL-4. Taken together, our data demonstrate a central role of TREM2 in the regulation of microglia response to acute neurotoxic insults and suggest a potential modulatory role of TSPO in response to immune system deficit.

"Food allergy is a common health problem worldwide, with increasing prevalence during recent decades. The only approved treatments for food allergy are food avoidance and administration of emergency medications in case of accidental exposure, which negatively affects patients' quality of life, so new treatments are highly desirable. Different food immunotherapy modalities have recently been used, with variable success rates in the induction of desensitization and tolerance, and different numbers and types of adverse reactions. Adverse reactions, especially intolerable gastrointestinal symptoms, are the most important causes of immunotherapy withdrawal. Eosinophilic esophagitis has been reported as a complication of milk, egg, and peanut oral immunotherapies and sublingual immunotherapy for respiratory allergies, but not for food allergies. Eosinophilic gastritis and eosinophilic colitis also rarely happened following egg and milk oral immunotherapies. The patients undergoing oral and sublingual immunotherapies should be closely followed up for a long time, and those with gastrointestinal symptoms should be evaluated by endoscopy of the gastrointestinal tract. These complications are usually reversible after early diagnosis and stopping the immunotherapy protocol. (C) 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel

"Glycosylation of many proteins has been revealed to be closely related with food allergies, and screening and structural analysis of related glycoproteins and glycoallergens are essential for studies in this field. Herein, we describe detailed N-glycoform analysis of all glycoprotein fractions of soybean protein isolate (SPI) separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) to disclose structural features of the glycan moieties of more soybean glycoproteins. SPI was fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and the generated protein bands were recovered and subjected to in-gel N-glycan release and labeling using a one-pot method newly developed by our group, followed by detailed analysis by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and online hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC-ESI-MS/MS). As a result, we found seven bands mainly containing oligomannose-type glycans; two mainly contain core alpha 1,3-facosylated glycans, and six have no glycans. This study is the first report that discovers core alpha 1,3-fucosylated N-glycans in bands 1, 2, and 6 and discloses bands 3, 4, 5, and 7 as glycoproteins and their N-glycoforms. Therefore, it can expand our knowledge about soybean protein glycosylation and provide significant structural reference for research of soybean allergens.

"Background: Default mode network (DMN) is vulnerable to the effects of APOE genotype. Given the reduced brain volumes and APOE epsilon 4-related brain changes in elderly carriers, it is less known that whether these changes would influence the functional connectivity and to what extent. This study aimed to examine the functional connectivity within DMN, and its diagnostic value with age-related morphometric alterations considered. Methods: Whole brain and seed-based resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) analysis were conducted in cognitively normal APOE epsilon 4 carriers and matched non-carriers (N=38). The absolute values of mean correlation coefficients (z-values) were used as a measure of functional connectivity strength (FCS) between DMN subregions, which were also used to estimate their diagnostic value by receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results: APOE epsilon 4 carriers demonstrated decreased interhemispheric FCS, particularly between right hippocampal formation (R.HF) and left inferior parietal lobular (L.IPL) (t=3.487, p<0.001). ROC analysis showed that the FCS of R.HF and L.IPL could differentiate APOE epsilon 4 carriers from healthy counterparts (AUC value=0.734, p=0.025). Moreover, after adjusting the impact of morphometry, the differentiated value of FCS of R.HF and L.IPL was markedly improved (AUC value=0.828, p=0.002). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that APOE epsilon 4 allele affects the functional connectivity within posterior DMN, particularly the atrophy-corrected interhemispheric FCS before the clinical expression of neurodegenerative disease.

"It is hard to estimate optical flow given a realworld video sequence with camera shake and other motion blur. In this paper, we first investigate the blur parameterisation for video footage using near linear motion elements. We then combine a commercial 3D pose sensor with an RGB camera, in order to film video footage of interest together with the camera motion. We illustrate that this additional camera motion/trajectory channel can be embedded into a hybrid framework by interleaving an iterative blind deconvolution and warping based optical flow scheme. Our method yields improved accuracy within three other state-of-the-art baselines given our proposed ground truth blurry sequences; and several other realworld sequences filmed by our imaging system.

"In our previous studies we have shown that seeing another person live with a direct vs. averted gaze results in enhanced skin conductance responses (SCRs) indicating autonomic arousal and in greater relative left-sided frontal activity in the electroencephalography (asymmetry in the alpha-band power), associated with approach motivation. In our studies, however, the stimulus persons had a neutral expression. In real-life social interaction, eye contact is often associated with a smile, which is another signal of the sender's approach-related motivation. A smile could, therefore, enhance the affective-motivational responses to eye contact. In the present study, we investigated whether the facial expression (neutral vs. social smile) would modulate autonomic arousal and frontal EEG alpha-band asymmetry to seeing a direct vs. an averted gaze in faces presented live through a liquid crystal (LC) shutter. The results showed that the SCRs were greater for the direct than the averted gaze and that the effect of gaze direction was more pronounced for a smiling than a neutral face. However, in this study, gaze direction and facial expression did not affect the frontal EEG asymmetry, although, for gaze direction, we found a marginally significant correlation between the degree of an overall bias for asymmetric frontal activity and the degree to which direct gaze elicited stronger left-sided frontal activity than did averted gaze.

"To develop pH responsive hydrogels, N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) has been grafted on to chitosan by free radical initiation method using azoisobutrylnitrile (AIBN) as an initiator. The optimum grafting conditions were worked out for grafting of NIPAM onto 1 g of chitosan by varying one reaction parameter at a time and keeping all other parameters constant. Binary monomers were grafted for five different concentrations of comonomers acrylic acid (AAc), acrylamide (AAm) and acrylonitrile (AN) at optimum grafting conditions evaluated for GMA alone onto chitosan. The grafted copolymers were analyzed by FTIR, TGA/DTA, XRD and SEM. The swelling studies for the grafted samples were performed at various pH in order to explore their end use in sorption of Cr(VI), Fe(II) and Cu(II) ions from water system. Metal ion sorption behaviour of polymeric samples was studied as function of time, temperature and pH. Various metal ion sorption parameters such as percent uptake (P-u), partition coefficient (K-d) and retention capacity (Q(r)) were discussed. Chitosan grafted with binary monomers NIPAM-co-AAc and NIPAM-co-AAm showed best results for sorption of all three metal ions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"With its relatively small key size, elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) is considered as the public-key cryptographic algorithm of choice for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In this work, we implemented ECC in the frequency domain, that is,by using the number theoretic transform, and without using hardware multiplier support, on the constrained MSP430 microcontroller widely used in WSNs. Our 169-bit ECC implementation uses Edwards curves and performs scalar point multiplication in only 1.97 and 0.98s for multiplication of random and fixed points, respectively. Unlike many implementations in literature, our implementation does not use hardware multiplier support, which makes it desirable for low-power applications on constrained WSN platforms. To our knowledge, this study presents the first ever software implementation of ECC in the frequency domain on a constrained low-power microcontroller without hardware multiplier support.

"Network structures and human behaviors are considered as two important factors in virus defense currently. However, due to ignorance of network security, normal users usually take simple activities, such as reinstalling computer system, or using the computer recovery system to clear virus. How system recovery influences virus spreading is not taken into consideration currently. In this paper, a new virus propagation model considering the system recovery is proposed first, and then in its steady-state analysis, the virus propagation steady time and steady states are deduced. Experiment results show that models considering system recovery can effectively restrain virus propagation. Furthermore, algorithm with system recovery in BA scale-free network is proposed. Simulation result turns out that target immunization strategy with system recovery works better than traditional ones in BA network.

"For the thermal hydraulics analysis of nuclear reactor components of LWRs (Light Water Reactors) such as reactor vessel, steam generator, containment, a multi-dimensional two-phase flow code, named CUPID, has been being developed. The CUPID code pursues a capability of multi-physics and multi scale thermal hydraulics analysis. In the present study, multi-scale simulation was performed by coupling with system-scale code, MARS. The coupled code was assessed to visualize the flow behavior of the steam generator of the Advanced Power Reactor (APR1400). The primary side of the steam generator and remaining Reactor Coolant System (RCS) is modeled by MARS and secondary side is by CUPID. For the secondary side simulation by the CUPID part, a porous media approach was adopted to two-fluid model and conductor model to simplify the complicated geometry of the steam generator. In order to obtain a porosity of a given computing cell, a special algorithm was employed to directly calculate volume ratio by mapping the 3D CAD file onto the grid system. Besides, the proper constitutive relationships for U-tubes are considered further. To treat the complex thermo-hydraulic phenomena on the shell side of a steam generator, a set of constitutive models available in the literature for a two-phase flow map, interfacial heat and mass transfer, interfacial drag, wall friction, wall heating, and heat partitioning in flows over tube bundles were applied to close the numerical model. This paper presents the description of the coupling method, porous media approach to simplify the steam generator, and the simulation results using the coupled code. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"The flow field with a high order scheme is usually calculated so as to solve complex flow problems and describe the flow structure accurately. However, there are two problems, i.e., the reduced-order boundary is inevitable and the order of the scheme at the discontinuous shock wave contained in the flow field as the supersonic flow field is low. It is questionable whether the reduced-order boundary and the low-order scheme at the shock wave have an effect on the numerical solution and accuracy of the flow field inside. In this paper, according to the actual situation of the direct numerical simulation of the flow field, two model equations with the exact solutions are solved, which are steady and unsteady, respectively, to study the question with a high order scheme at the interior of the domain and the reduced-order method at the boundary and center of the domain. Comparing with the exact solutions, it is found that the effect of reduced-order exists and cannot be ignored. In addition, the other two model equations with the exact solutions, which are often used in fluid mechanics, are also studied with the same process for the reduced-order problem.

"Objective We aimed to 1) identify clinical and genetic associations of sacroiliitis (SI) in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and 2) describe the different radiographic patterns of SI in PsA and their clinical and genetic associations. Methods 283 PsA patients, fulfilling CASPAR criteria, underwent detailed skin and rheumatologic assessments. In addition, HLA-B* 27 and B* 080101 status was recorded, which have been shown as the key genetic markers of radiographic SI in PsA. Grade 2 Unilateral or bilateral radiographic changes of SI were required for inclusion and involvement was further defined as asymmetrical or symmetrical. Results 70 patients (25%) had radiographic SI; all either with a present or past history of backache. Regression analysis demonstrated a significant association of SI with peripheral joint erosions (p=0.043), PASI maximum (p=0.041), younger age of PsA onset (p=< 0.001), presence of HLA-B* 0801 (p=0.002) and only marginal significance with HLA-B* 2705 (p=0.059). Asymmetrical SI was noted in 51 patients (73%). In striking contrast to those patients with symmetrical SI, patients with asymmetrical SI were more likely to be female (p=0.04), have a trend towards more severe nail disease (p=0.08) and peripheral joint erosions (p=0.08), more osteolysis (p=0.01), more HLA-B* 0801 positivity (p=0.001) and much less HLA-B* 270502 positivity (p=< 0.001). Conclusion PsA developing at a younger age, severe skin disease, peripheral joint erosions, and HLA-B* 0801 are significantly associated with SI, and there was only a marginal trend towards significance for HLA-B* 2705. HLA-B* 27 positive Axial-PsA patients resemble AS, while HLA-B* 0801 positive Axial-PsA patients have asymmetrical and/or unilateral SI, which are typical of PsA.

"Interactive narratives offer interesting opportunities for the study of the impact of media on behavior. A growing amount of research on games advocating social change, including those focusing on interactive narratives, has highlighted their potential for attitudinal and behavioral impact. In this study, we examine the relationship between interactivity and prosocial behavior, as well as potential underlying processes. A yoked study design with 634 participants compared an interactive with a noninteractive narrative. Structural equation modeling revealed no significant differences in prosocial behavior between the interactive and noninteractive condition. However, support for the importance of appreciation for and engagement with a narrative on subsequent prosocial behavior was observed. In summary, while results shed light on processes underlying the relationship between both noninteractive and interactive narratives and prosocial behavior, they also highlight interactivity as a multifaceted concept worth examining in further detail.

"Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) weaken the antitumor immune response through the inhibition of effector T cell activity and the production of immunosuppressive factors in pathological sites. It is well established that interleukin-17A (IL-17A) has a remarkable role on the promotion of inflammation and tumor formation, and IL-17 has been implicated in the enhancement of immunosuppression of MDSCs, which consequently promotes tumor progression. A detailed study of this relationship remains elusive. In our study, we not only confirmed the promotion of IL-17 on Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) development but also surprisingly showed that IL-17 could extend the fate and enhance the immunosuppressive effect of MDSCs through activating ERK1/2. Additionally, the effect of IL-17 on MDSCs was reversed, even in tumors by blocking ERK1/2. Interdicting the signaling molecule ERK1/2 could increase the apoptosis of MDSCs and weaken the suppressive activity of MDSCs, so that thereafter, the antitumor immunity could be restored partly. Therefore, these findings offer new insights into the importance of IL-17 and the downstream signaling factor ERK1/2 for MDSCs.

"Background: Substance use disorder (SUD) is an important health problem that requires a complex range of care because of the chronic nature of the disorder and the multiple psychosocial problems involved. Current outpatient programs often have difficulties in delivering and coordinating ongoing care and access to different healthcare providers. Various case management (CM) models have been developed, first for patients in other psychiatric domains and then for patients with SUD, in order to improve treatment outcomes. Aim: This paper aims to assess the effectiveness of CM for patients with SUD. Methods: We performed a systematic review of CM interventions for patients with SUD by analyzing randomized controlled studies published on the subject between 1996 and 2016 found on the electronic database PubMed. Results and conclusion: Fourteen studies were included in the analysis. Differences between studies in outcome measures, populations included, and intervention characteristics made it difficult to compare results. Most of these studies reported improvement in some of the chosen outcomes. Treatment adherence mostly improved, but substance use was reported to decrease in only a third of the studies. Overall functioning improved in about half of the studies. The heterogeneity of the results might be linked to these differences between studies. Further research is needed in the field.

"Past work suggested that dual identity was effective to reduce prejudice. This study extended research on dual identity and prejudice by identifying a boundary condition in this relationship, that is, group permeability. In Study 1, we replicated previous studies with Chinese individuals and found that inducing dual identity (emphasizing subgroup differences and a common nation identity), compared to the control condition, decreased the urban residents' prejudice against rural-to-urban migrants. In Study 2, we manipulated the group boundary permeability using the Hukou system reform, and found that when the group boundary was permeable, dual identity was effective in reducing prejudice against rural-to-urban migrants. However, this effect vanished in the condition where the group boundary was impermeable. These results point to the importance of inducing dual identity under specific conditions for research on decreasing prejudice. Some practical implications of the findings for urbanization and immigration are discussed.

"It is useful and challenging to analyze and select object features of very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery. The overwhelming majority of existing feature selection methods always concatenate all of the features into a long feature vector and then select features from the vector, ignoring the homogeneity and heterogeneity of underlying feature subspaces. In this paper, we propose a supervised multiview feature selection (SMFS) method. Unlike the existing multiview methods, SMFS requires no prior knowledge of the number of views, and is independent of a prefixed classifier. By utilizing homogeneity and heterogeneity of the data, SMFS employs affinity propagation to automatically decompose features into multiple disjoint and meaningful feature groups or views without any prior knowledge. A group or view consists of homogeneous features, describing a unique data characteristic. Different views represent heterogeneous data characteristics. Then, features are evaluated and selected based on joint l(1,2)-norm minimization of a loss function and a regularization term. Different from the popular l(1,2)-norm, joint l(1,2)-norm enforces the intraview sparsity, instead of interview sparsity. Consequently, a view can be represented by a few representative features in each view, and the information of heterogeneous views can be well kept by the remaining representative features. The experimental results on four VHR satellite images attest to the effectiveness and practicability of SMFS in comparison with single-view algorithms. Furthermore, some discussions are conducted to give insights into homogeneity and heterogeneity of features.

"The tractability of the budding yeast genome has provided many insights into the fundamental mechanisms regulating cellular life. With the advent of synthetic biology and single-cell measurements, novel tools are required to manipulate the yeast genome in a more controlled manner. We present, here, a new family of yeast shuttle vectors called single integration vectors (pSIV). Upon transformation in yeast, these plasmids replace the entire deficient auxotrophy marker locus by a cassette containing an exogenous marker. As shown using flow cytometry, this complete replacement results in a unique integration of the desired DNA fragment at the marker locus. In addition, a second transcriptional unit can be inserted to achieve the simultaneous integration of two constructs. The selection marker cassettes, present in the pSIV, were also used to generate a complete set of gene tagging plasmids (pGT) encompassing a large palette of fluorescent proteins, from a cyan fluorescent protein to a near-infrared tandem dimer red fluorescent protein. These tagging cassettes are orthogonal to each other thanks to the use of different TEF promoter and terminator couples, thereby avoiding marker cassette switching and favoring integration in the desired locus. In summary, we have created two sets of robust molecular tools for the precise genetic manipulation of the budding yeast.

"Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is among the most stress-tolerant crops; however, not much is known about the genetic and environmental control of metabolic adaptation of barley to abiotic stresses. We have subjected a genetically diverse set of 81 barley accessions, consisting of Mediterranean landrace genotypes and German elite breeding lines, to drought and combined heat and drought stress at anthesis. Our aim was to (i) investigate potential differences in morphological, physiological, and metabolic adaptation to the two stress scenarios between the Mediterranean and German barley genotypes and (ii) identify metabolic quantitative trait loci (mQTLs). To this end, we have genotyped the investigated barley lines with an Illumina iSelect 9K array and analyzed a set of 57 metabolites from the primary C and N as well as antioxidant metabolism in flag leaves under control and stress conditions. We found that drought-adapted genotypes attenuate leaf carbon metabolism much more strongly than elite lines during drought stress adaptation. Furthermore, we identified mQTLs for flag leaf gamma-tocopherol, glutathione, and succinate content by association genetics that co-localize with genes encoding enzymes of the pathways producing these antioxidant metabolites. Our results provide the molecular basis for breeding barley cultivars with improved abiotic stress tolerance.

The application is a simulation of Mars, within which the collaborators must come to agreement over; for example, where the Rover should land and go. The first contribution is the creation of an MR system supporting contextualization of NVC. Two technological contributions are prototyping a technique to subtract a person from a background that may contain physical objects and/or moving images and a lightweight texturing method for multiview rendering, which provides balance in terms of visual and temporal quality. A practical contribution is the demonstration of pragmatic approaches to sharing space between display systems of distinct levels of immersion. A research tool contribution is a system that allows comparison of conventional authored and video-based reconstructed avatars, within an environment that encourages exploration and social interaction. Aspects of system quality, including the communication of facial expression and end-to-end latency are reported.

"Although the system reliability theory has a high capability in quality quantification, while system reliability optimization (SRO) has been well developed in manufacturing engineering, seldom can their applications be found in the construction industry. This study aims to develop a system reliability theory based multiple-objective optimization model to conduct SRO, and then identify the cost-quality trade-off solution for construction projects. First the whole construction project is treated as a system composed of different work packages. Second, the reliability function is employed to quantify the quality performance and the nonlinear cost-reliability function is set up. Moreover, according to the physical arrangements among each work package, the system reliability structural function is determined. Third, the total construction cost minimization and system reliability maximization are defined as multiple-objectives. The particle swarm optimization algorithm is employed to search for the Pareto-optimal solutions, from which the final cost-quality trade-off solution can be selected. A real construction case is used to evaluate the workability of the proposed model and the results have fully proven its validity and practicality. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"Background: Food allergen labeling is an important tool to reduce risk of exposure and prevent anaphylaxis for individuals with food allergies. Health Canada released a Canadian food allergen labeling regulation (2008) and subsequent update (2012) suggesting that research is needed to guide further iterations of the regulation to improve food allergen labeling and reduce risk of exposure. Objective: The primary objective of this study was to examine consumer preferences in food labeling for allergy avoidance and anaphylaxis prevention. A secondary objective was to identify whether different subgroups within the consumer population emerged. Methods: A discrete choice experiment using a fractional factorial design divided into ten different versions with 18 choice-sets per version was developed to examine consumer preferences for different attributes of food labeling. Results: Three distinct subgroups of Canadian consumers with different allergen considerations and food allergen labeling needs were identified. Overall, preferences for standardized precautionary and safety symbols at little or no increased cost emerged. Conclusion: While three distinct groups with different preferences were identified, in general the results revealed that the current Canadian food allergen labeling regulation can be improved by enforcing the use of standardized precautionary and safety symbols and educating the public on the use of these symbols.

"Efficient leaf water supply is fundamental for assimilation processes and tree growth. Renovating the architecture of the xylem transport system requires an increasing carbon investment while growing taller, and any deficiency of carbon availability may result in increasing hydraulic constraints to water flow. Therefore, plants need to coordinate carbon assimilation and biomass allocation to guarantee an efficient and safe long-distance transport system. We tested the hypothesis that reduced branch elongation rates together with carbon-saving adjustments of xylem anatomy hydraulically compensate for the reduction in biomass allocation to xylem. We measured leaf biomass, hydraulic and anatomical properties of wood segments along the main axis of branches in 10 slow growing (SG) and 10 fast growing (FG) Fraxinus ornus L. trees. Branches of SG trees had five times slower branch elongation rate (7 vs 35 cm year(-1)), and produced a higher leaf biomass (P < 0.0001) and thinner xylem rings with fewer but larger vessels (P0.05) and xylem safety (Psi(50) approximate to -3.2 MPa). Slower elongation rate coupled with thinner annual rings and larger vessels allows the reduction of carbon costs associated with growth, while maintaining similar leaf-specific conductivity and xylem safety.

"Novelty seeking (NS) is a core personality trait that primes the susceptibility to drug addiction. Striatal dopamine activity contributes to cognitive flexibility, an important cognitive strategy to inhibit impulsivity and compulsive drug-seeking behavior. Evidence supports the association between dopamine and NS. Opioid-dependent patients show higher levels of NS, and repeated opioid exposure can cause cognitive deficits including poor cognitive flexibility and impaired impulse control. However, in opioid-dependent patients, the link between NS, striatal dopamine activity, and cognitive flexibility is still unclear. We recruited 22 opioid-dependent individuals and 30 age and sex-matched healthy controls. Single-photon emission computed tomography with [Tc-99m]TRODAT-1 as a ligand was used to measure the striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) availability. The Trail Making Test (TMT) was performed to assess cognitive flexibility. Cloninger's Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ) was used to measure NS. We found that in opioid-dependent patients, the striatal DAT availability was lower and negatively associated with TMT Part B +/- Part A. Moreover, an inverted-U shape significantly matched the scores of NS as a function of the striatal DAT availability, with maximum NS potential in the midrange of the DAT availability. An extra sum-of-squares F test was conducted, indicating that a quadratic model fitted the association between the DAT and NS better than a linear model did. In brief, in opioid-dependent patients, the striatal DAT availability is nonlinearly linked to NS and linearly linked to cognitive flexibility. The role of the striatal DAT in the transition from controlled to compulsive opioid use warrants further research. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

"Attachment has recently been proposed as a key developmental construct in psychosis, in particular with respect to interpersonal functioning and social cognition. The current study examined the latent structure of the self-report Psychosis Attachment Measure (PAM) and its relationship to lower-level perceptual and higher-order inferential social cognitive processes. The PAM was administered to 138 psychiatrically stable outpatients with schizophrenia alongside a battery of symptom, social cognitive, and functional measures. PAM responses were analyzed using latent variable measurement models, which did not yield evidence of the coherent two-dimensional structure predicted by previous literature. A unidimensional subscale comprising 6 of the 16 original PAM items possessed the strongest psychometric properties. This subscale was generally uncorrelated with social cognitive measures and showed weak correlations with some symptoms measures and with community functioning. These results suggest that either the PAM may not measure attachment in psychosis or it may measure only attachment anxiety but demonstrate little construct validity in this population. These results tell a cautionary tale regarding making theoretical inferences on the basis of measures without coherent latent structure. Attachment measures with stronger psychometric properties will help clarify putative relationships between attachment and social cognitive processes in psychosis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

"We present in this paper a new generic approach to variable branching in branch and bound for mixed integer linear problems. Our approach consists in imitating the decisions taken by a good branching strategy, namely strong branching, with a fast approximation. This approximated function is created by a machine learning technique from a set of observed branching decisions taken by strong branching. The philosophy of the approach is similar to reliability branching. However, our approach can catch more complex aspects of observed previous branchings to take a branching decision. The experiments performed on randomly generated and MIPLIB problems show promising results.

"To the best of our knowledge, we present the first hardware implementation of isogeny-based cryptography available in the literature. Particularly, we present the first implementation of the supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) key exchange, which features quantum-resistance. We optimize this design for speed by creating a high throughput multiplier unit, taking advantage of parallelization of arithmetic in F p(2), and minimizing pipeline stalls with optimal scheduling. Consequently, our results are also faster than software libraries running affine SIDH even on Intel Haswell processors. For our implementation at 85-bit quantum security and 128-bit classical security, we generate ephemeral public keys in 1.655 million cycles for Alice and 1.490 million cycles for Bob. We generate the shared secret in an additional 1.510 million cycles for Alice and 1.312 million cycles for Bob. On a Virtex-7, these results are approximately 1.5 times faster than known software implementations running the same 512-bit SIDH. Our results and observations show that the isogeny-based schemes can be implemented with high efficiency on reconfigurable hardware.

"The main objective of this study was to analyse the outcomes after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) of a group of patients with at least one self-reported allergy and a group of patients without reported allergies. We hypothesized there is a significant negative influence on clinical outcome scores after TKA in patients with self-reported allergies. Four-hundred and seventy-five patients who had undergone TKA were analysed preoperatively and 1 year after surgery. The WOMAC, KSS and SF-36 scores were obtained. The patients' Yesavage depression questionnaire score was also recorded. The scores of the 330 (69.5 %) patients without self-reported allergies were compared to the scores of the 145 (30.5 %) patients with at least one self-reported allergy in the medical record. Preoperative scores were similar in both groups. The WOMAC post-operative scores (23.6 vs 20.4; p = 0.037) and the KSS-Knee score (91.1 vs 87.6; p = 0.027) were worse in the group of patients with self-reported allergies than in the group without allergies. The scores from the Yesavage depression questionnaire and in the SF-36 were similar in both groups. Patients with at least one self-reported allergy have worse post-operative outcomes in terms of the WOMAC and KSS-Knee scores after TKA than patients without allergies. These poor outcomes do not seem to be related to depression. Therefore, more research is needed to explain them. Reported allergies could be considered a prognostic factor and used when counselling TKA patients. I.

"Xylazine is used in veterinary medicine for sedation, anesthesia, and analgesia. It has also been reported to be misused as a horse doping agent, a drug of abuse, a drug for attempted sexual assault, and as source of accidental or intended poisonings. So far, no data concerning human metabolism have been described. Such data are necessary for the development of toxicological detection methods for monitoring drug abuse, as in most cases the metabolites are the analytical targets. Therefore, the metabolism of xylazine was investigated in rat and human urine after several sample workup procedures. The metabolites were identified using gas chromatography (GC)-mass spectrometry (MS) and liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with linear ion trap high-resolution multistage MS (MS (n) ). Xylazine was N-dealkylated and S-dealkylated, oxidized, and/or hydroxylated to 12 phase I metabolites. The phenolic metabolites were partly excreted as glucuronides or sulfates. All phase I and phase II metabolites identified in rat urine were also detected in human urine. In rat urine after a low dose as well as in human urine after an overdose, mainly the hydroxy metabolites were detected using the authors' standard urine screening approaches by GC-MS and LC-MS (n) . Thus, it should be possible to monitor application of xylazine assuming similar toxicokinetics in humans.

"Of the 57 human cytochromes P450 (P450) and 58 pseudogenes discovered to date, (http:// drinelson.utmem.edu/CytochromeP450.html), 1/4 still remain orphans in the sense that their function, expression sites, and regulation are still largely not elucidated. The posthuman genome-sequencing project era has presented the research community with novel challenges. Despite many insights gathered about gene location and genetic variations in our human genome, we still lack important knowledge about these novel P450 enzymes and their functions in endogenous and exogenous metabolism, as well as their possible roles in the metabolism of toxicants and carcinogens. Our own list of such orphans currently consists of 13 members: P450 2A7, 2S1, 2U1, 2W1, 3A43, 4A22, 4F11, 4F22, 4V2, 4X1, 4Z1, 20A1, and 27C1. Some of the orphans, e.g. P450s 2W1 and 2U1, already have putative assigned functions in arachidonic acid metabolism and may activate carcinogens. However, at this point, for the majority of them more knowledge is available about their genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms than of their biological functions. It is noteworthy that most P450 orphans express high interspecies sequence conservation and have orthologs in rodents (e.g. CYP4X1/Cyp4x1, CYP4V2/Cyp4v3). This review summarizes recent knowledge about the P450 orphans and questions remaining about their specific roles in human metabolism.

"Since decades, cross-cultural psychology examines moral values using data from standardized surveys, assuming that values guide human behavior. We add to this literature by studying the link between moral values and various forms of prosocial behavior, using data from respondents of the sixth World Values Survey in Germany who participated in an online behavioral experiment. The experiment consists of a series of incentivized tasks and allows us to elaborate the association between survey-measured values and three facets of observed prosocial behavior. The evidence boils down to three findings. While (a) emancipative values relate to higher common pool contributions and (b) higher donations to charitable organizations, (c) secular values are linked with more productive and less protective investments. As these results conform to key theories and reach empirical significance in a major postindustrial nation, we conclude that we have important evidence at hand highlighting the potential of combined survey-experiment methods to establish value-behavior links that are otherwise inexplorable.

"As a driven accelerator, the CYCIAE-100 cyclotron is designed by China Institute of Atomic Energy for the Beijing Radio Ion-beam Facility project. The cyclotron RF system is designed to use two RF power sources of 100 kW to drive two half-wavelength cavities respectively. Two Dee accelerating electrodes are kept separately from each other inside the cyclotron, while their accelerating voltages are maintained in phase by the efforts of LLRF control. An analog-digital hybrid LLRF system has been developed to achieve cavity tuning control, dee voltage amplitude and phase stabilization etc. The analog subsystems designs are focused on RF signal up/down conversion, tuning control, and dee voltage regulation. The digital system provides an RF signal source, aligns the cavity phases and maintains a Finite State Machine. The digital parts combine with the analog functions to provide the LLRF control. A brief system hardware introduction will be given in this paper, followed by the review of several major characteristics of the digital control in the 100 MeV cyclotron LLRF system. The commissioning is also introduced, and most of the optimization during the process was done by changing the digital parts. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"BACKGROUND: Blood-injection-injury (B-I-I) phobia is capable of producing inaccurate hypoxic challenge testing results due to anxiety-induced hyperventilation. CASE REPORT: A 69-yr-old woman with a history of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, restrictive spirometry, exercise desaturation requiring supplementary oxygen on mobilizing, reduced DLco, and B-I-I phobia was referred for hypoxic challenge testing (HCT) to assess in-flight oxygen requirements. HCT was performed by breathing a 15% F(I)o(2) gas mixture, simulating the available oxygen in ambient air onboard aircraft pressurized to an equivalent altitude of 8000 ft. S(p)o(2) fell to a nadir value of 81% during HCT, although it rapidly increased to 89% during the first of two attempts at blood gas sampling. A resultant blood gas sample showed an acceptable Po-2 outside the criteria for recommending in-flight oxygen and a reduced Pco(2). Entering the nadir S(p)o(2) value into the Severinghaus equation gives an estimated arterial Po-2 of 6 kPa (45 mmHg), which was felt to be more representative of resting values during HCT, and in-flight oxygen was recommended. DISCUSSION: While hyperventilation is an expected response to hypoxia, transient rises in S(p)o(2) coinciding with threat of injury are likely to be attributable to emotional stress-induced hyperventilation, characteristic of B-I-I specific phobia and expected during the anticipation of exteroceptive threat, even in normal subjects. In summary, should excessive hyperventilation be detected during HCT and coincide with transient increases in S(p)o(2), HCT should be repeated using S(p)o(2) only as a guide to the level of hypoxemia, and Spot maintained using supplementary oxygen in accordance with alternative methods described in guidelines.

"Detecting the shape of the non-rigid molten metal during welding, so-called weld pool visual sensing, is one of the central tasks for automating arc welding processes. It is challenging due to the strong interference of the high-intensity arc light and spatters as well as the lack of robust approaches to detect and represent the shape of the nonrigid weld pool. We propose a solution using active contours including an prior for the weld pool boundary composition. Also, we apply Adaboost to select a small set of features that captures the relevant information. The proposed method is applied to weld pool tracking and the presented results verified its feasibility. Note to Practitioners-Welding quality is highly dependent on the human welder's experiences and skills in the gas tungsten arc welding process. In particular, detecting the shape of the nonrigid molten metal during welding plays an important role in improving the welding quality since it provides a prime feedback mechanism for welding control. However, this is a challenging task due to a number of reasons, e.g., strong interference and changing working environment. Applying classical image processing algorithms directly, such as active contour models (ACM), cannot guarantee satisfactory performance due to the above-mentioned reasons. Actually, in practice, ACM more often than not failed to capture the welding pool boundary. In this work, we integrate an application-dependent prior to the definition of the energy functional of a traditional ACM, thus allowing us to use machine learning techniques to improve the performance of traditional ACM. In density estimation of the prior, AdaBoost is utilized to select features that are most suitable for Gaussian Bayesian classifiers to differentiate wanted boundaries and unwanted ones (e.g., spurious boundaries caused by interfering noise). The proposed approach improves the perfor-mance of the traditional ACM and captures the boundary of the welding pool successfully. It can also be generalized to other applications that need to integrate application-dependent priors to enhance classical methods, which may otherwise be not applicable in real-world implementations.

"The stone column is a useful method for increasing the bearing capacity and reducing the settlements of foundations. The confinement provided by the native soft soils has an effective influence on the stone column bearing capacity. In this paper, laboratory tests were performed on unreinforced and reinforced geotextile-encased stone columns. Tests were performed on columns with diameters of 60, 80, and 100 mm and a length to diameter ratio of 5. Vertical encased stone columns (VESC) and horizontal reinforced stone columns (HRSC) were used for stone column reinforcement to investigate the effect of reinforcement type on the bearing capacity. The main objective of this research is to study the efficiency of VESC and HRSC under the same conditions for diameters of 60, 80, and 100 mm. Experimental results show that the bearing capacity of stone columns increases using vertical or horizontal reinforcing material. Moreover, the bearing capacity of reinforced stone columns increases by increasing the strength of reinforcement in both VESC and HRSC. Results show that bulging failure mechanism governed in all tests and that lateral bulging decreases using geotextiles and increasing strength of reinforcement. In addition, for both VESC and HRSC, the stress concentration ratio of the columns also increases.

"Hypertension (HTN) is one of the most common emerging disease in developing countries. It alters endothelial cell structure and function, resulting in several diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, peripheral vasculopathy, cerebrovascular disease and nephropathy. Although much progress has been made in researching HTN in recent years, early diagnosis and treatment of HTN are not yet satisfactory, and progression control/treatment is still poor. MicroRNAs are well-known regulators of the physiological and developmental processes of HTN. Our results revealed that miR-510 was upregulated in blood samples from HTN patients, whereas no significant differences were observed in the control samples. Methylation analyses corroborated the miR-510 upregulation in patient samples. These results suggested that miR-510 can be used as a novel biomarker for diagnosis and as a new therapeutic target for HTN.

"SUMMARY The main aspect of this paper is to show that the stability of linear time-variant systems cannot be estimated from the location of the eigenvalues. For this purpose, two simple time-variant electrical circuits are presented, which have constant eigenvalues. As will be shown, the time-variant circuits can be asymptotically stable although there is a positive eigenvalue and this circuit can be unstable despite negative eigenvalues only. The idea behind is a suited time-variant state transformation of a linear time-invariant system. An electrical interpretation of both systems and of state transformations allows for an energetic evaluation from an electrical point of view even though the analytical solution is not necessarily known.

"Alzheimer's disease is a complex progressive neurodegenerative brain disorder, being its prevalence expected to rise over the next decades. Unconventional strategies for elucidating the genetic mechanisms are necessary due to its polygenic nature. In this work, the input information sources are five: a public DNA microarray that measures expression levels of control and patient samples, repositories of known genes associated to Alzheimer's disease, additional data, Gene Ontology and finally, a literature review or expert knowledge to validate the results. As methodology to identify genes highly related to this disease, we present the integration of three machine learning techniques: particularly, we have used decision trees, quantitative association rules and hierarchical cluster to analyze Alzheimer's disease gene expression profiles to identify genes highly linked to this neurodegenerative disease, through changes in their expression levels between control and patient samples. We propose an ensemble of decision trees and quantitative association rules to find the most suitable configurations of the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm GarNet, in order to overcome the complex parametrization intrinsic to this type of algorithms. To fulfill this goat, GarNet has been executed using multiple configuration settings and the well-known C4.5 has been used to find the minimum accuracy to be satisfied. Then, GarNet is rerun to identify dependencies between genes and their expression levels, so we are able to distinguish between healthy individuals and Alzheimer's patients using the configurations that overcome the minimum threshold of accuracy defined by C4.5 algorithm. Finally, a hierarchical cluster analysis has been used to validate the obtained gene-Alzheimer's Disease associations provided by GarNet The results have shown that the obtained rules were able to successfully characterize the underlying information, grouping relevant genes for Alzheimer Disease. The genes reported by our approach provided two well defined groups that perfectly divided the samples between healthy and Alzheimer's Disease patients. To prove the relevance of the obtained results, a statistical test and gene expression fold-change were used. Furthermore, this relevance has been summarized in a volcano plot, showing two clearly separated and significant groups of genes that are up or down-regulated in Alzheimer's Disease patients. A biological knowledge integration phase was performed based on the information fusion of systematic literature review, enrichment Gene Ontology terms for the described genes found in the hippocampus of patients. Finally, a validation phase with additional data and a permutation test is carried out, being the results consistent with previous studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"Background: Previous studies have suggested that fear memories can be updated when recalled, a process referred to as reconsolidation. Given the beneficial effects of model-based safety learning (i.e. vicarious extinction) in preventing the recovery of short-term fear memory, we examined whether consolidated long-term fear memories could be updated with safety learning accomplished through vicarious extinction learning initiated within the reconsolidation time-window. We assessed this in a final sample of 19 participants that underwent a three-day within-subject fear-conditioning design, using fear-potentiated startle as our primary index of fear learning. Methods: On day 1, two fear-relevant stimuli (reinforced CSs) were paired with shock (US) and a third stimulus served as a control (CS). On day 2, one of the two previously reinforced stimuli (the reminded CS) was presented once in order to reactivate the fear memory 10 min before vicarious extinction training was initiated for all CSs. The recovery of the fear memory was tested 24 h later. Results and conclusion: Vicarious extinction training conducted within the reconsolidation time window specifically prevented the recovery of the reactivated fear memory (p = 0.03), while leaving fear potentiated startle responses to the non-reactivated cue intact (p = 0.62). These findings are relevant to both basic and clinical research, suggesting that a safe, non-invasive model-based exposure technique has the potential to enhance the efficiency and durability of anxiolytic therapies.

"Harnessing the immune system to fight cancer is an exciting advancement in lung cancer therapy. Antitumor immunity can be augmented by checkpoint blockade therapy, which removes the inhibition/brakes imposed on the immune system by the tumor. Checkpoint blockade therapy with anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1)/anti-programmed death ligand 1 (anti-PDL-1) antibodies causes tumor regression in about 25% of patients with lung cancer. In another approach, the immune system is forced or accelerated to attack the tumor through augmentation of the antitumor response against mutations carried by each lung tumor. This latter approach has become feasible since the advent of next-generation sequencing technology, which allows identification of the specific mutations that each individual lung tumor bears. Indeed lung cancers are now known to have high mutation rates, making them logical targets for mutation-directed immune therapies. We review how sequencing of lung cancer mutations leads to better understanding of how the immune system recognizes tumors, providing improved opportunities to track antitumor immunity and ultimately leading to the development of personalized vaccine strategies aimed at unleashing the host immune system to attack mutations in the tumor.

"Structural systems are subject to uncertainties due to variability in many hard-to-control noise factors, which include external loads, material properties, and construction workmanship. Traditional structural design methodologies, although clearly recognizing the presence of uncertainty, omit robustness against the effects of uncertainty in the design process. First, if the actual uncertainties in the design process are underestimated, the design may fail to satisfy safety requirements. Second, to guarantee safety in the presence of high variability of the system response, the structural designer may be forced to choose an overly conservative, thus inefficient and costly design. When robustness against uncertainty is not treated as one of the design objectives, the trade-off between over-design for safety and under-design for cost-savings is exacerbated. This manuscript demonstrates that safe and cost-effective structural engineering designs maybe achieved by implementing Robust Design concepts originally developed in manufacturing engineering to consider robustness against uncertainty. This manuscript presents an optimization-based methodology for the application of Robust Design principles to structural design and demonstrates its application on an academic problem involving design of a reinforced-concrete frame.

"Liquid manure applied in agricultural lands improves soil quality. However, incorrect management of manure may cause environmental problems due to sediments and nutrients losses associated to runoff. The aims of this work were to: (i) evaluate the time effect of post-liquid dairy manure (LDM) application on runoff, sediment and nutrient losses; (ii) compare the effect of conventional tillage and no-till systems on runoff, sediment and nutrients losses after LDM application. A rainfall simulation experiment was conducted on intact soil blocks collected from fields that had been under conventional tillage and no-till systems. Rainfall was applied 24 h or 7 days after LDM application. Conventional tillage without manure application resulted on higher runoff, sediment and nutrient losses (mainly the particulate fraction) than no-till without manure. The greatest runoff, sediment and nutrients losses occurred in the treatments where simulated rainfall was performed 24 h after LDM application independent of the tillage system. An interval of 7 days between manure application and the rainfall event reduced sediment, particulate P, and particulate N losses in both conventional and no-till systems. In practical terms, we would recommend a minimum of 7 days between LDM application and rainfall-runoff event to provide agronomic benefits minimizing the potential risk of water pollution.

It became difficult work of administrators to extract and analysis the abnormal and normal patterns from large amounts of the network traffic data. Currently, traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS) are unsuitable to store a large amount of data because they are designed for storing and processing the structured data. Hive is a data warehouse tool built on top of Hadoop for storing, processing, querying, and analysis the large amount of data.

As the result, in some scenario, MySQL outperform a cluster of four Hive nodes on querying the ICMP protocol information, nevertheless, MySQL database that stored more than the network traffic data about 45 million records cannot be query the TCP protocol information. Moreover, we observed that the average query response times of Hive in Hadoop cluster that reduce continuously be scale up node into the cluster.

"Background: Pim-3 kinase is a highly homologous serine/threonine kinase that is overexpressed in hematological malignancies and solid tumors. Few studies have been conducted to define the role of Pim-3 in solid tumors, especially in prostate cancer. The aim of this study was to define the role of Pim-3 in development and prognosis of prostate cancer. Material/Methods: We collected specimens from 160 patients with prostate cancer, as well as 100 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Realtime polymerase chain reaction was used for the assessment of Pim-3 expression at the RNA level and Western blot was used to quantify the Pim-3 protein synthesis in 3 different cell lines. Results: We found that Pim-3 mRNA expression in prostate cancer tissue was significantly higher than that in benign prostatic hyperplasia tissue (p<0.05). Accordingly, the protein level expression of Pim-3 in prostate cancer cell lines was also significantly higher than that in control cells. In addition, the expression status of Pim-3 mRNA was significantly associated with pathological parameters such as pre-surgery prostate specific antigen, Gleason score, pathological stage, and lymphoid metastasis. High expression of Pim-3 also significantly decreased the survival rate of patients after surgery. Conclusions: Pim-3 expression is an important risk factor for prostate cancer; we are the first team to report Pim-3 as a valuable biomarker in Chinese.

Commercial grade ReBa2Cu3O7-x (Re=Y or rare earths, ReBCO) tape and epoxy resin have been used for coil winding.

"While an understanding of the structure and function of a generically described immune system is essential in contemporary biomedicine, it is clear that a one-size-fits-all approach applied across multiple species is fraught with contradictions and inconsistencies. Nevertheless, the breakthroughs achieved in immunology following the application of observations in murine systems to that of man have been pivotal in the advancement of biology and human medicine. However, as additional species have been used to further address biologic and safety assessment questions relative to the structure and function of the immune system, it has become clear that there are differences across species, gender, age and strain that must be considered. The meaningfulness of these differences must be determined on a case-by-case basis. This review article attempts to collect, consolidate and discuss some of these species differences thereby aiding in the accurate placement of new observations in a proper immunobiological and immunopathological perspective.

"Analytical methods used for pharmaceuticals and drugs of abuse in sewage play a fundamental role in wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) studies. Here quantitative analysis of drug metabolites in raw wastewaters is used to determine consumption from general population. Its great advantage in public health studies is that it gives objective, real-time data about community use of chemicals, highlighting the relationship between environmental and human health. Within a WBE study on salbutamol use in a large population, we developed a procedure to distinguish human metabolic excretion from external source of contamination, possibly industrial, in wastewaters. Salbutamol is mainly excreted as the sulphate metabolite, which is rapidly hydrolyzed to the parent compound in the environment, so this is currently not detected. When a molecule is either excreted un-metabolized or its metabolites are unstable in the environment, studies can be completed by monitoring the parent compound. In this case it is mandatory to assess whether the drug in wastewater is present because of population use or because of a specific source of contamination, such as industrial manufacturing waste. Because commercial salbutamol mainly occurs as a racemic mixture and is stereoselective in the human metabolism, the enantiomeric relative fraction (EFrel) in wastewater samples should reflect excretion, being unbalanced towards one of two enantiomers, if the drug is of metabolic origin. The procedure described involves chiral analysis of the salbutamol enantiomers by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) and calculation of EFrel, to detect samples where external contamination occurs. Samples were collected daily between October and December 2013 from the Milano Nosedo wastewater treatment plant. Carbamazepine and atenolol were measured in the sewage collector, as control drugs. Salbutamol EFrel was highly consistent in all samples during this three-month period, but a limited number of samples had unexpectedly high concentrations where the EFrel was close to that observed of the un-metabolized, commercially available drug, supporting the idea of an external source of contamination, besides human metabolic excretion. Results showed that, when present, non-metabolic daily loads could be evaluated indicating an average of 4.12 g/day of salbutamol extra load due to non-metabolic sources. The stereoselectivity in metabolism and enantiomeric ratio analysis appears to be a useful approach in WBE studies to identify different sources of drugs in the environment, when no metabolic products are present at useful analytical levels.

"In recent years, a major global challenge being faced in manufacturing industry, which requires low energy consumption, low pollution, low emission, less use of non-renewable resources, excellent market competitiveness and cost control capability, better protection of occupational health and safety, excellent technical performance, is to address the associated multifaceted context in environment, economy, society and technology. Many researchers and practitioners have thus been making great efforts in sustainable manufacturing in order to take on the challenges in a comprehensive and scientific manner. As the advanced manufacturing equipment, CNC machine tools particularly their design and applications need to adapt and cope with the increasing demands for sustainability capability and features. Incorporating sustainability at the design stage of CNC machine tools is an effective measure linking to the sustainable design and analysis of machines in particular. However, there is no universally accepted design guidelines and design methodologies for sustainable CNC machine tools yet. At present, many researchers and practitioners focus on one or two specific technologies, such as reducing energy consumption and reducing pollution emissions, for the sustainable performance of CNC machine tools. The study of the comprehensive quantitative analysis for the sustainable performance is still lacking. Therefore, in this paper a sustainable design index (SDI) oriented approach is presented for the machine design and analysis within the CAD/CAE environment. It is expected to be quantitative analysis oriented and applicable to the engineering manufacture in an industrial feasible manner. This analysis model quantitatively evaluates the design scheme of machine tools in four aspects covering environment, economy, society and technology, using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) methods. This SDI analysis model consists of an indexing system, which can fully reflect the sustainable performance of design schemes, and a synthesis algorithm which can accurately calculate the sustainable design index value based on the following criterion levels: energy consumption, pollution emissions, costs, modular design, lightweight design, security, accuracy and processing capability. To enhance the application of SDI analysis model in CAD/CAE environment, we develop a new plugin program, which has been written in Visual Basic. This program can calculate the sustainable design index value for each design schemes by using original design values and weights. Using the approach and the associated tool developed, designers can determine a more sustainable machine design scheme, and further improve the sustainable performance of the machine by applying sustainable design index (SDI) based assessment indicators. A case study shows that the sustainable design performance of design scheme B is 38.10% better than design scheme A.

"This study applies multispectral band ratios to examine vegetation density and vegetation health to assess drought conditions over nearly 30 years (1989-2016) in Tuy Phong district, Binh Thuan province, Vietnam using a sequence of Landsat imagery (TM and OLI). Our research area has a distinctive climate, characterized by arid and semiarid areas adjacent to Binh Thuan's coastline. Drought is likely intensified by rain shadow effects of the Central Highlands (part of the Truong Son- or the Annamese Cordillera, positioned immediately west of the province). The seasonal Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were calculated to derive three other indices: Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI), and Vegetation Health Index (VHI). Results show that approximately two-thirds of Tuy Phong district was influenced by mid-to-severe drought. During the dry season (November to the following April), severity of drought has increased both intensively and extensively toward the North. Hypotheses testing of correlation between LST and NDVI also revealed a significantly negative relationship - increasing surface temperature and decreasing NDVI. To validate our results, we applied the same procedure for generating the VHI from MODIS data. Despite the absence of historical datasets for our region, Landsat data shows many advantages in monitoring drought in remote and small areas compared to MODIS. Our research strategies may be effective in other regions without sufficient climatic records for conventional climatic analysis.

"Scholars have argued that opposition to welfare is, in part, driven by stereotypes of African Americans. This argument assumes that when individuals think about welfare, they spontaneously think about Black recipients. We investigated people's mental representations of welfare recipients. In Studies 1 and 2, we used a perceptual task to visually estimate participants' mental representations of welfare recipients. Compared with the average non-welfare-recipient image, the average welfare-recipient image was perceived (by a separate sample) as more African American and more representative of stereotypes associated with welfare recipients and African Americans. In Study 3, participants were asked to determine whether they supported giving welfare benefits to the people pictured in the average welfare-recipient and non-welfare-recipient images generated in Study 2. Participants were less supportive of giving welfare benefits to the person shown in the welfare-recipient image than to the person shown in the non-welfare-recipient image. The results suggest that mental images of welfare recipients may bias attitudes toward welfare policies.

"The purpose of the present investigation was to assess whether interpersonal closeness facilitates earlier emotion detection as the emotional expression unfolds. Female undergraduate participants were either paired with a close friend or an acquaintance (n = 92 pairs). Participants viewed morphed movies of their partner and a stranger gradually shifting from a neutral to either a sad, angry, or happy expression. As predicted, findings indicate a closeness advantage. Close friends detected the onset of their partners' angry and sad expressions earlier than acquaintances. Additionally, close friends were more accurate than acquaintances in identifying angry and sad expressions at the onset, particularly in non-vignette conditions when these expressions were void of context. These findings suggest that closeness does indeed facilitate emotional perception, particularly in ambiguous situations for negative emotions.

"Background. Contact allergies to the preservatives formaldehyde and methylchloroisothiazolinone (MCI)/methylisothiazolinone (MI) have been reported to appear together at a statistically significant level. Recently, revisions concerning the patch test preparations of MCI/MI, MI and formaldehyde have been recommended for the European baseline series. Aim. To investigate (i) the number of concomitant contact allergies to the preservatives, (ii) the number of concomitant contact allergies to the preservatives and the fragrance mixes (FM I and FM II) and (iii) gender differences. Methods. Patients testedwith theSwedish baseline series during the period 2012-2014 at the Department of Occupational and Environmental Dermatology in Malm, Sweden were investigated. Results. 2165 patients were patch tested with the baseline series (34% males and 66% females). Contact allergies to formaldehyde and MCI/MI and/or MI were significantly associated (p<0.001). The associations between contact allergy to MCI/MI and/or MI and FMI and/or FM II, and between formaldehyde and FMI and/or FM II as well as, were statistically significant (p<0.001). Conclusion. Contact allergies to formaldehyde and MCI/MI and/or MI are significantly associated, as well as contact allergies to these preservatives and fragrance allergy. Males and females do not differ significantly concerning contact allergy to fragrances.

"Animal studies suggest that N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) dependent signalling in limbic and prefrontal regions is critically involved in both cognitive and emotional functions. In humans, ketamine-induced transient, and disorder associated chronic NMDAR hypofunction (i.e. in schizophrenia) has been associated with deficient performance in the domains of memory and higher-order emotional functioning, as well as altered neural activity in the underlying limbic-prefrontal circuits. To model the effects of NMDAR hypofunction on the integration of emotion and cognition the present pharmacological fMRI study applied the NMDAR antagonist ketamine (target plasma level=100 ng/ml) to 21 healthy volunteers in a within-subject placebo controlled crossover design during encoding of neutral, positive and negative pictures. Our results show that irrespective of emotion, ketamine suppressed parahippocampal and medial prefrontal activity. In contrast, ketamine selectively increased amygdala and orbitofrontal activity during successful encoding of negative stimuli. On the network level ketamine generally increased medial prefrontal-parahippocampal coupling while specifically decreasing amygdala-orbitofrontal interplay during encoding of negative stimuli. On the behavioural level, ketamine produced generally decreased memory performance and abolished the emotional enhancement of memory after a wash-out period of 5 days. The present findings suggest that ketamine produces general as well as valence-specific effects during emotional memory formation. The pattern partly overlaps with alterations previously observed in patients with schizophrenia.

"Cortical networks underpinning attentional control and mentalizing converge at the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ). It is debated whether the rTPJ is fractionated in neighboring, but separate functional modules underpinning attentional control and mentalizing, or whether one overarching cognitive mechanism explains the rTPJ's role in both domains. Addressing this question, we combined attentional control and mentalizing in a factorial design within one task. We added a social context condition, in which another individual's mental states became apparently task-relevant, to a spatial cueing paradigm. This allowed for assessing cue validity-and context-dependent functional activity and effective connectivity of the rTPJ within corresponding cortical networks. We found two discriminable rTPJ subregions, an anterior and a posterior one. Yet, we did not observe a sharp functional dissociation between these two, as both regions responded to attention cueing and social context manipulation. The results suggest that the rTPJ is part of both the ventral attention and the ToM network and that its function is defined by context-dependent coupling with the respective network. We argue that the rTPJ as a functional unit underpins an overarching cognitive mechanism in attentional control and mentalizing and discuss how the present results help to further specify this mechanism.

"Stormwater runoff infiltration brings about some concerns regarding its potential impact on both soil and ground-water quality; besides, the fate of contaminants in source-control devices somewhat suffers from a lack of documentation. The present study was dedicated to assessing the spatial distribution of three heavy metals (copper, lead, zinc) in the surface soil of ten small-scale infiltration facilities, along with several physical parameters (soil moisture, volatile matter, variable thickness of the upper horizon). High-resolution samplings and in-situ measurements were undertaken, followed by X-ray fluorescence analyses and spatial interpolation. Highest metal accumulation was found in a relatively narrow area near the water inflow zone, from which concentrations markedly decreased with increasing distance. Maximum enrichment ratios amounted to >20 in the most contaminated sites. Heavy metal patterns give a time-integrated vision of the non-uniform infiltration fluxes, sedimentation processes and surface flow pathways within the devices. This element indicates that the lateral extent of contamination is mainly controlled by hydraulics. The evidenced spatial structure of soil concentrations restricts the area where remediation measures would be necessary in these systems, and suggests possible optimization of their hydraulic functioning towards an easier maintenance. Heterogeneous upper boundary conditions should be taken into account when studying the fate of micropollutants in infiltration facilities with either mathematical modeling or soil coring field surveys.

"Low oxygen pressure or hypoxia is often an obstacle in pathological conditions, including during cancer development and metastatic dissemination. The main family of transcription factors involved in the adaptation to inappropriate oxygen levels are the 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factors' (HIFs) that together with HIF prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) regulate many different processes, during physiological as well pathological conditions. Additionally, the entire HIF transcription cascade is involved in the 'seventh' hallmark of cancer; tumor promoting inflammation. Previous work revealed that HIF-pathway proteins influence tumor associated immune cells in their action toward proliferation, differentiation, vessel normalization and tumor dissemination. These changes are not necessarily analogous to the role of these proteins in non-tumor related immune responses, where hypoxia often encourages a strong inflammatory response. Recently, Clever et al. demonstrated that T-cell intrinsic inhibition of all three PHDs (PHD1-3) is necessary but sufficient to limit CD4(+)-regulatory T (T-reg) cell induction and stimulates CD8(+) T cell effector function. Interestingly, this resulted in the inhibition of local tolerance in the lung but reduced tumor colonization. In this perspective, we discuss the effect of targeting HIF-pathway proteins in tumor-associated cell lineages, their therapeutic prospective and possible pitfalls.

"Hypervisors enable cloud computing model to provide scalable infrastructures and on-demand access to computing resources as they support multiple operating systems to run on one physical server concurrently. This mechanism enhances utilization of physical server thus reduces server count in the data center. Hypervisors also drive the benefits of reduced IT infrastructure setup and maintenance costs along with power savings. It is interesting to know different hypervisors' performance for the consolidated application workloads. Three hypervisors ESXi, XenServer, and KVM are carefully chosen to represent three categories full virtualized, para-virtualized, and hybrid virtualized respectively for the experiment. We have created a private cloud using CloudStack. Hypervisors are deployed as hosts in the private cloud in the respective clusters. Each hypervisor is deployed with three virtual machines. Three applications web server, application server, and database servers are installed on three virtual machines. Experiments are designed using Design of Experiments (DOE) methodology. With concurrently running virtual machines, each hypervisor is stressed with the consolidated real-time workloads (web load, application load, and OLTP) and important system information is gathered using SIGAR framework. The paper proposes a new scoring formula for hypervisors' performance in the private cloud for consolidated application workloads and the accuracy of the results are complemented with sound statistical analysis using DOE.

"Infrahumanization research has verified that in intergroup contexts, there is a strong tendency to attribute secondary emotions, which are uniquely human, to the ingroup, while limiting that attribution in outgroups. Experiments have shown it to be as common as ingroup bias. However, it is not yet known what characteristics may mitigate this trend. This paper presents two studies. The first analyzes the impact of helping behavior on attributions of human traits to two fictitious groups. The second study's objective was to determine if members of the Spanish ingroup would infrahumanize an Ethiopian outgroup less when that outgroup performs prosocial behavior towards another group. Infrahumanization was determined by a lexical decision task, using the names of ingroup and outgroup members as priming. The results demonstrate that describing a fictitious group in altruistic terms increases their human profile (experiment one) and reduces infrahumanization (experiment two).

"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatic lipotoxicity results from and contributes to obesity-related disorders. It is a challenge to study human metabolism of fatty acids (FAs) in the liver. We combined (11)C-palmitate imaging by positron emission tomography (PET) with compartmental modeling to determine rates of hepatic FA uptake, oxidation, and storage, as well as triglyceride release in pigs and human beings. METHODS: Anesthetized pigs underwent (11)C-palmitate PET imaging during fasting (n = 3) or euglycemic hyperinsulinemia (n = 3). Metabolic products of FAs were measured in arterial, portal, and hepatic venous blood. The imaging methodology then was tested in 15 human subjects (8 obese subjects); plasma (11)C-palmitate kinetic analyses were used to quantify systemic and visceral lipolysis. RESULTS: In pigs, PET-derived and corresponding measured FA fluxes (FA uptake, esterification, and triglyceride FA release) did not differ and were correlated with each other. In human beings, obese subjects had increased hepatic FA oxidation compared with controls (mean +/- standard error of the mean, 0.16 +/- 0.01 vs 0.08 +/- 0.01 mu mol/min/mL; P = .0007); FA uptake and esterification rates did not differ between obese subjects and controls. Liver FA oxidation correlated with plasma insulin levels (r = 0.61, P = .016), adipose tissue (r = 0.58, P = .024), and systemic insulin resistance (r = 0.62, P = .015). Hepatic FA esterification correlated with the systemic release of FA into plasma (r = 0.71, P = .003). CONCLUSIONS: PET imaging can be used to measure FA metabolism in the liver. By using this technology, we found that obese individuals have increased hepatic oxidation of FA, in the context of adipose tissue insulin resistance, and increased FA flux from visceral fat. FA flux from visceral fat is proportional with the mass of the corresponding depot.

"Although studies often find racial disparities in policing outcomes, less is known about how suspect race biases police interactions as they unfold. This study examines what is differentially occurring during police-suspect interactions for White, Black, and Latino suspects across time. It is hypothesized that racial bias may be more evident earlier in interactions, when less information about the situation is available. One hundred thirty-nine (62 White, 42 Black, and 35 Latino) use-of-force case files and associated written narratives from a medium to large size urban police department in the United States were analyzed. Trained coders broke down the interaction narratives into discrete sequences, or dyadic action-reaction steps involving a suspect action (level of resistance) and an officer response (level of force). A linear mixed-effects model was run on amount of police use of force by suspect race and time, with suspect resistance and suspect actions toward third-party/self as controls. Results demonstrated that Black and Latino suspects receive more force in the beginning stages of the interaction, whereas Whites escalated in level of force faster after initial levels. By breaking down police-suspect interactions into discrete sequences, the current study reveals a better understanding of when bias originates in police use of force and informs how to focus policing interventions.

"One of the most important of the nutrient intake values (NIVs) is the average nutrient requirement (ANR). The ANR is defined as an intake value that will be adequate for half of the individuals in a group of people with similar characteristics. It is used to estimate the prevalence of adequacy, and it serves as the basis for the individual nutrient level (INLx). The determination of adequacy is a complex process, with the resulting value of the ANR dependent on the criterion or functional outcome chosen to define nutrient adequacy. Because nutrients have multiple sites Of action in human metabolism, it is possible to demonstrate abnormal function in one parameter measured or observed as a result of inadequate intake of a nutrient, while other parameters requiring the same nutrient appear normal or within normal ranges. Thus, depending on the criterion of adequacy selected, the requirement for a given nutrient may be at a lower or a higher intake amount. In harmonizing development of NIVs, it is important to clearly identify the criterion of adequacy selected and the rationale for its selection. Rarely are available data sufficient to provide dose-response information from which to select a level of intake at which half of the individuals demonstrate adequacy and half appear to demonstrate inadequacy. Three levels of intake, of which at least one level of intake is below the requirement for most of the individuals in the sample, and one level of intake is above their requirement, are useful for establishing, a level at which half of the group might be considered to demonstrate adequacy. Types of human nutrient studies that may be used to obtain data are discussed, as well as characteristics Of the sample size needed to demonstrate adequacy. The variation in requirements is also an important aspect in predicting levels of intake that will have defined probabilities of adequacy for groups (to develop the INLx, where x is the defined probability chosen). An analysis of the origins of different types of variability is presented. When estimating energy requirements, a special case of NIVs, important issues must be considered. Additionally, an example of evaluating data used to establish an ANR for vitamin A, and the effect of variability in requirements for vitamin A, is provided.

"The growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance calls for new approaches in the development of antimicrobial therapeutics. Likewise, improved diagnostic measures are essential in guiding the application of targeted therapies and preventing the evolution of therapeutic resistance. Discovery platforms are also needed to form new treatment strategies and identify novel antimicrobial agents. By applying engineering principles to molecular biology, synthetic biologists have developed platforms that improve upon, supplement, and will perhaps supplant traditional broad-spectrum antibiotics. Efforts in engineering bacteriophages and synthetic probiotics demonstrate targeted antimicrobial approaches that can be fine-tuned using synthetic biology-derived principles. Further, the development of paper-based, cell-free expression systems holds promise in promoting the clinical translation of molecular biology tools for diagnostic purposes. In this review, we highlight emerging synthetic biology platform technologies that are geared toward the generation of new antimicrobial therapies, diagnostics, and discovery channels.

"Based on the orthogonal superposition theorem of three alternating magnetic components, a universal uniform magnetic spin vector is superimposed using tri-axial Helmholtz coils, achieving successive digital control of the orientation, the rotational speed, and the magnetic flux density of the universal magnetic spin vector. For increasing the magnitude and orientation accuracy of the magnetic spin vector, this paper presents a mathematical model associated with the magnitude error and orientation error of the universal magnetic spin vector, along with a double error compensation method for the magnitude and orientation of the universal magnetic spin vector superimposed by three alternating magnetic components. The double error compensation method includes the current magnitude compensation by three different structural coefficients of tri-axial Helmholtz coils and the current phase compensation by two relative phase differences under linear polarization. The results have shown that the double compensation method can increase the magnitude and orientation accuracy of the rotating magnetic vector effectively, which would achieve an accurate posture adjustment and steering control on the capsule robots in curving environment.

"This paper describes the design, measurement methodology, and experimental validation of an electronic system for monitoring the electrical discontinuity in rails of double-track railway lines in order to detect the rail breakage. The electronic system is based on an emitter node and on the two receiver nodes. The three nodes, together with the four rails to be analyzed, constitute the electrical circuits, whose currents are measured in both the emission and reception nodes. These nodes can communicate through a data network between them, as well as with a remote center that controls and synchronizes the electronic systems along the railway line. The electronic subsystem associated with the emitter node transmits an encoded signal to the rails, modulated by an 800-Hz carrier. A set of eight currents are measured, one per rail at each end of the section defined between the emitter and the receiver, with a maximum length of 7 km. The evaluation of electrical discontinuities in each section is carried out by means of the relative imbalances that can appear between the eight measured currents, according to possible breakages. The method of measurement is characterized by a high immunity to noise. The results presented here are based on a railway line prototype, which implements the electrical propagation models and coupling between the four rails in the double track. This model allows the proposed electronic system and measurement methodology to be successfully verified.

"Objective: A clinician's ability to infer patients' thoughts and feelings is a critical component of high quality care. The goal of this article is to present a new test to measure this ability in clinicians, called the Test of Accurate Perception of Patients' Affect (TAPPA). Methods: Audiovisual clips were taken from patients' actual medical visits. The patients reviewed the videotape after the visit to identify their thoughts and feelings during the visit. This information was used to extract short audiovisual clips for which the correct answer was the patient's report of the thought or feeling associated with that clip. The TAPPA contains 48 audiovisual clips, each responded to in a multiple choice format. Results: The TAPPA showed good psychometric properties (optimal mean and good variance, adequate internal consistency, and strong re-test reliability) and convergent validity with other tests of emotion recognition. In addition, the test showed predicted better performance by female than male participants. Conclusion: The TAPPA promises to be a valuable tool for research and education on provider-patient relationships and quality of care. Practice implications: A tool for testing clinicians' understanding of patients' thoughts and feelings may contribute to better quality of care and to improved selection and training.

"Pediatricians working in an emergency environment are confronted with children admitted to emergency departments for intoxication on a daily basis. We carried out a retrospective cohort study of children admitted to a pediatric emergency department due to unintentional cannabis exposure over a 10-year period from 2004 to 2014. Twenty-nine children under the age of 3 were admitted with a positive cannabis urine test. Eighty-seven percent of intoxications occurred at the family home. Resin was the main form of ingested cannabis (69%). The mean age was 16.5 +/- 5.2 months, and mean weight was 11.1 +/- 2.1 Kg. Sixty percent of admissions occurred between 2012 and 2014. More severe presentations, based on Poisoning Severity Score, occurred over the past 2 years. Four children experienced seizures before admission. Ten children (34%) had a decreased level of consciousness (GCS < 12) and were admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit for 12-24 h. All of them had ingested hashish (resin). The majority (70%) of children suffering from neurological impairment were admitted in the last year, of whom three required assisted ventilation. There were no cases with major outcomes and no deaths. Parents were not assessed regarding their cannabis consumption. Conclusion: This study supports the impression that accidental child poisonings with cannabis have been more serious than previously thought for 2 years. This observation may be explained by (1) the increased THC concentration in cannabis and (2) the widespread use in young adults, even after they become parents. Introducing an addiction team inside the PED could help to improve the care links with these parents.

"Objective: As many inflammatory rheumatic diseases affect patients in childbearing age, some concern has been expressed about the safety of biologic drugs during pregnancy. This study evaluated the effects of anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) agents on pregnancy/foetal outcomes. Methods: Thirty-eight pregnancies were followed prospectively from November 2008 to February 2015. Information about the patients' exposure to anti-TNF alpha, disease activity, DMARD therapy, pregnancy/foetal outcomes were registered. Results: Twenty-four/38 (71.1%) pregnancies were exposed to anti-TNF alpha at conception/I trimester, 11/38 (28.9%) prior to conception and 3 (11.1%) following paternal exposure. There were two congenital malformations: one infant (4.2%) was diagnosed with congenital diaphragmatic hernia and obstructive megaureter; the mother was exposed to adalimumab at conception/I trimester. While one foetus (9.1%) showed a trisomy 16, the mother 38 year-old had suspended etanercept 4 weeks before conception. There was no significant difference in pregnancy/foetal outcome between the two groups. Nor were there any significant differences in pregnancy/foetal outcomes in the various groups being treated with different anti-TNF alpha antagonists. No congenital malformations were found in connection to paternal exposure. Conclusion: Study results suggest that anti-TNF alpha drugs could be safe when administered during conception/I trimester and following paternal exposure. (C) 2016 Societe francaise de rhumatologie.

"Early diagnosis of inborn errors of metabolism is commonly performed through biofluid metabolomics, which detects specific metabolic biomarkers whose concentration is altered due to genomic mutations. The identification of new biomarkers is of major importance to biomedical research and is usually performed through data mining of metabolomic data. After the recent publication of the genome-scale network model of human metabolism, we present a novel computational approach for systematically predicting metabolic biomarkers in stochiometric metabolic models. Applying the method to predict biomarkers for disruptions of red-blood cell metabolism demonstrates a marked correlation with altered metabolic concentrations inferred through kinetic model simulations. Applying the method to the genome-scale human model reveals a set of 233 metabolites whose concentration is predicted to be either elevated or reduced as a result of 176 possible dysfunctional enzymes. The method's predictions are shown to significantly correlate with known disease biomarkers and to predict many novel potential biomarkers. Using this method to prioritize metabolite measurement experiments to identify new biomarkers can provide an order of a 10-fold increase in biomarker detection performance.

In this paper, we turn the matching problem into a Markov Random Field (MRF) optimization problem and propose a fast and accurate image registration method based on message passing to screen out mismatches caused by the conventional SIFT-based algorithm. The proposed method comprises three steps. First, a SIFT detector is used to detect key points and then these points are described by Daisy instead of the SIFT detector (to improve efficiency); second, a new geometric constraint with distance and direction terms is designed and incorporated into sequential tree-reweighted message passing (TRW-S) this obtains the coarse matching result; finally, the RANSAC algorithm is adopted to filter out the mismatches and obtain an accurate transformation. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the efficiency and the accuracy of the registration process and secures a desirable result

"The degree to which isohydric or anisohydric behaviour extends to the water balance of developing fruits has not previously been explored. Here, we examine the water relations and hydraulic behaviour of Vitis vinifera L. berries during development from two contrasting cultivars that display isohydric (cv. Grenache) or anisohydric (cv. Shiraz) behaviour. Hydraulic resistance normalised to the berry surface area of Grenache clusters was significantly lower and more constant during development, whereas that of Shiraz increased. Lower rachis hydraulic resistance in Grenache compared with Shiraz was inversely related to xylem vessel diameter. Berry transpiration and xylem water uptake measured on detached berries decreased alike during development. From veraison, detached berries of both cultivars showed a transition to a net imbalance between xylem water uptake and transpiration, with Shiraz showing a larger imbalance and berry dehydration towards the end of ripening. In planta, this imbalance must be counterbalanced by a larger phloem water influx in post-veraison berries. Concurrently, the calculated pressure gradients for xylem water uptake showed a decline, which broadly agreed with the measured values. Higher suction for xylem water uptake in pre-veraison berries was mainly generated by transpiration. We conclude that isohydric or anisohydric behaviour is reflected in the contrasting behaviour of fruit hydraulics and that a change from xylem water uptake to phloem import is correlated with the loss of the propensity to generate negative apoplastic pressure in the berry.

"A sustainable strategy for conjunctive water management must include information on the temporal and spatial availability of this natural resource. Because of water shortages in the dry seasons, farmers on the Upper Plain of the Chao Phraya River basin, Thailand, are increasingly using groundwater to meet their irrigation needs. To evaluate the possibilities of conjunctive water management in the area, the spatial-temporal changes in the water table of the Younger Terrace Aquifer were investigated. First, a regional geomorphological map based on field surveys, remote sensing and previous environmental studies was developed. Then, the well data were analyzed in relation to rainfall, streamflow, yield and pumpage, and the data were interpolated using geostatistical techniques. The results were analyzed via integrated zoning based on color theory as applied to multivariate visualization. The analysis results indicate areas that would be more suitable for groundwater extraction in a conjunctive management framework with regard to the natural hydrogeological processes and the effects of human interaction. The kriging results were compared with the geomorphological map, and the geomorphological areas exhibit distinct hydrogeological patterns. The western fans exhibit the best potential for the expansion of conjunctive use, whereas the borders of the northern fans exhibit the lowest potential.

"Conditional differential cryptanalysis on NFSR-based cryptosystems was first proposed by Knellwolf et al. in Asiacrypt 2010 and has been successfully used to attack reduced variants of Grain v1. In this paper, we greatly improve conditional differential attacks on Grain v1 in the following four aspects. First, a new differential engine is derived to correctly track the differential trails of Grain v1. Second, we propose a new difference-searching strategy which serves to find suitable differences for the conditional differential attack on a given reduced variant of Grain v1. Third, a highly IV-saving condition-imposing strategy is presented. Last, we propose a further bias-increasing strategy. In particular, the improvements on the difference-searching strategy and the condition-imposing strategy are crucial to mount conditional differential attacks on the variants of Grain v1 with more than 106 rounds. It is shown that the improved conditional differential attacks could retrieve 31 distinct secret key expressions for 107-round Grain v1 and could retrieve 15 distinct secret key expressions for 110-round Grain v1. Both the attacks succeed with constant probabilities. Thus far, our results are the best known for the reduced variants of Grain v1 as far as the number of rounds attacked is concerned.

"The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is committed to preventing and ending homelessness among U.S. veterans, but there have been few estimates of the incidence of veteran homelessness and prospective studies to identify predictors of homelessness. This study examines the 1-year incidence of homelessness among veterans seen in VA specialty mental health clinics and identified sociodemographic and clinical predictors of homelessness. Using a retrospective cohort study design, data were extracted from the VA medical records of 306,351 veterans referred to anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder clinics across 130 VA facilities from 2008-2012 and followed for 1 year after referral. Homeless incidence was defined as new use of any VA homeless services or a documented International Classification of Diseases (9th rev.) V60.0 (lack of housing) code during the year. Of the total sample, 5.6% (7.8% for women and 5.4% for men) experienced homelessness within 1 year after referral to VA specialty mental health care. Veterans who were unmarried or diagnosed with a drug use disorder were more than twice as likely to become homeless; those who were Black or had annual incomes less than $25,000 were more than one and a half times as likely to become homeless. Together, these findings suggest a notable and important percentage of veterans seen in VA specialty mental health clinics newly experience homelessness annually. Monitoring early signs of housing vulnerability and preventing homelessness in this vulnerable but treatment-engaged population may be important in the VA's efforts to end veteran homelessness.

"Spousal revenge killers murder their child apparently out of a desire to cause harm to their ex-partner, the child's other parent. Standard explanations of these killings fail to provide an adequate solution to what I call the problem of spousal revenge filicide. This is the problem of how a killer comes to take their rage at their former partner out on their own child and how that child can be dehumanized to the point of murder. Although the dehumanization of the victim is acknowledged to occur, why it occurs is not well understood. Here, I offer an hypothesis that the killer fails to represent their child as a moral subject with a mind of their own. This is due to a deficit in the killer's capacity for person perception which is, by hypothesis, pathological. As such, the killer experiences the child as an object, rather than a person, which is of significant emotional value to the other parent. The specificity of this disorder explains why the ex-partner themselves is not targeted, and it explains how the killer is able to understand that killing the child will harm the other parent.

"Maintaining satisfactory properties in geosynthetics exposed to factors that could lead to their degradation needs to be considered in projects employing these materials. Geosynthetics subjected to tensile creep and weathering can undergo premature degradation over time. It is essential to study the influence of these factors, since they could act simultaneously in some applications. To assess the synergetic effects, frames were developed and four groups of a woven geotextile polypropylene sample were tested. The first and second groups were subjected to tensile creep at 5% and 10% of the tensile strength in conjunction with weathering for 2160 h. The third group was exposed to the same weathering conditions without tensile load. The fourth group was subjected to tensile creep at 10% of the tensile strength in laboratory conditions. Frames were built with a slope similar to the location of exposure to guarantee greater effects of weathering on the material surface. A meteorological station at the site monitored the meteorological parameters. The degradation suffered by the geotextile was determined by comparing tensile strength test results. The results presented show the importance of the constructed frames in assesssing tensile creep and weathering in the field under small loads.

"Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the deposition of amyloid-beta as extracellular plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau as intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. Tau pathology characterizes not only Alzheimer's disease, but also many other tauopathies, presenting tau as an attractive therapeutic target. Passive tau immunotherapy has been previously explored; however, because only a small fraction of peripherally delivered antibodies crosses the blood-brain barrier, enters the brain and engages with tau that forms intracellular aggregates, more efficient ways of antibody delivery and neuronal uptake are warranted. In the brain, tau exists as multiple isoforms. Here, we investigated the efficacy of a novel 2N tau isoform-specific single chain antibody fragment, RN2N, delivered by passive immunization in the P301L human tau transgenic pR5 mouse model. We demonstrate that, in treated mice, RN2N reduces anxiety-like behaviour and phosphorylation of tau at distinct sites. When administration of RN2N was combined with focused ultrasound in a scanning mode (scanning ultrasound), RN2N delivery into the brain and uptake by neurons were markedly increased, and efficacy was significantly enhanced. Our study provides evidence that scanning ultrasound is a viable tool to enhance the delivery of biologics across the blood-brain barrier and improve therapeutic outcomes and further presents single-chain antibodies as an alternative to full-length antibodies.

"Objectives: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a subtype of artificial neural network that have shown strong performance in computer vision tasks including image classification. To date, there has been limited application of CNNs to chest radiographs, the most frequently performed medical imaging study. We hypothesize CNNs can learn to classify frontal chest radiographs according to common findings from a sufficiently large data set. Materials and Methods: Our institution's research ethics board approved a single-center retrospective review of 35,038 adult posterior-anterior chest radiographs and final reports performed between 2005 and 2015 (56% men, average age of 56, patient type: 24% inpatient, 39% outpatient, 37% emergency department) with a waiver for informed consent. The GoogLeNet CNN was trained using 3 graphics processing units to automatically classify radiographs as normal (n = 11,702) or into 1 or more of cardiomegaly (n = 9240), consolidation (n = 6788), pleural effusion (n = 7786), pulmonary edema (n = 1286), or pneumothorax (n = 1299). The network's performancewas evaluated using receiver operating curve analysis on a test set of 2443 radiographs with the criterion standard being board-certified radiologist interpretation. Results: Using 256 x 256-pixel images as input, the network achieved an overall sensitivity and specificity of 91% with an area under the curve of 0.964 for classifying a study as normal (n = 1203). For the abnormal categories, the sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve, respectively, were 91%, 91%, and 0.962 for pleural effusion (n = 782), 82%, 82%, and 0.868 for pulmonary edema (n = 356), 74%, 75%, and 0.850 for consolidation (n = 214), 81%, 80%, and 0.875 for cardiomegaly (n = 482), and 78%, 78%, and 0.861 for pneumothorax (n = 167). Conclusions: Current deep CNN architectures can be trained with modest-sized medical data sets to achieve clinically useful performance at detecting and excluding common pathology on chest radiographs.

"Population-genomic analyses are essential to understanding factors shaping genomic variation and lineage-specific sequence constraints. The dearth of such analyses for unicellular eukaryotes prompted us to assess genomic variation in Paramecium, one of the most well-studied ciliate genera. The Paramecium aurelia complex consists of similar to 15 morphologically indistinguishable species that diverged subsequent to two rounds of whole-genome duplications (WGDs, as long as 320 MYA) and possess extremely streamlined genomes. We examine patterns of both nuclear and mitochondrial polymorphism, by sequencing whole genomes of 10-13 worldwide isolates of each of three species belonging to the P. aurelia complex: P. tetraurelia, P. biaurelia, P. sexaurelia, as well as two outgroup species that do not share the WGDs: P. caudatum and P. multimicronucleatum. An apparent absence of global geographic population structure suggests continuous or recent dispersal of Paramecium over long distances. Intergenic regions are highly constrained relative to coding sequences, especially in P. caudatum and P. multimicronucleatum that have shorter intergenic distances. Sequence diversity and divergence are reduced up to similar to 100-150 bp both upstream and downstream of genes, suggesting strong constraints imposed by the presence of densely packed regulatory modules. In addition, comparison of sequence variation at non-synonymous and synonymous sites suggests similar recent selective pressures on paralogs within and orthologs across the deeply diverging species. This study presents the first genome-wide population-genomic analysis in ciliates and provides a valuable resource for future studies in evolutionary and functional genetics in Paramecium.

"Age-associated alterations in cardiovascular structure and function induce cardiovascular disease in elderly subjects. To investigate the effects of normal vascular aging (NVA) and early vascular aging (EVA) on hemodynamic characteristics in the circle of Willis (CoW), a closed-loop one-dimensional computational model was developed based on fluid mechanics in the vascular system. The numerical simulations revealed that higher central pulse pressure and augmentation index (AIx) appear in the EVA subjects due to early arrival of reflected waves, resulted in the increase of cardiac afterload compared with the NVA subjects. Moreover, the hemodynamic characteristics in the CoW show that the EVA subjects in an older age display a higher blood pressure than that of the NVA with a complete CoW. Herein, the increased blood pressure and flow rate coexist in the subjects with an incomplete CoW. In conclusion, the hemodynamic characteristics in the aortic tree and CoW related to aging appear to play an important role in causing cardiovascular and intravascular disease.

"Software Defined Networking (SDN) has recently emerged to become one of the promising solutions for the future Internet. With the logical centralization of controllers and a global network overview, SDN brings us a chance to strengthen our network security. However, SDN also brings us a dangerous increase in potential threats. In this paper, we apply a deep learning approach for flow-based anomaly detection in an SDN environment. We build a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model for an intrusion detection system and train the model with the NSL-KDD Dataset. In this work, we just use six basic features (that can be easily obtained in an SDN environment) taken from the fortyone features of NSL-KDD Dataset. Through experiments, we confirm that the deep learning approach shows strong potential to be used for flow-based anomaly detection in SDN environments.

"Space and spatiality had been a thorn in philosophy's side from time immemorial. Spatiality, immediately associated with corporeality, finitude, even death, properly speaking constituted problems for philosophy; enigmas posed to philosophy to disrupt its cool complacency. The root of the difficulty, it seems, rests on nothing more than a prejudice: the rightful domain of philosophy is time, understood as pure continuous duration, the image of eternity; the compartmentalised units of space are (always in the plural) the province of cartographers and geographers, but certainly not the philosopher, lost in his transcendent contemplation. What follows then is a preliminary study, or better an etude deploying variations on a single theme: how can we liberate space from the Cartesian grid under which it has been imprisoned for so long, so as to open up its free expanse? What might it be to think of space as a form of duration, without breaks, without borders, without boundaries? And in the last instance, is this pure void not another name for the very being of consciousness itself?

"As originally shown by King and Altman, graph theory, and specifically the use of spanning trees, provides the means to solve the kinetics of any catalytic network in a steady state regime, taking as input data all the rate constants. Herein, it is shown that the translation of the rate constants to Gibbs energies provides a simpler way to estimate the energy span (i.e., the apparent activation energy of the full reaction), the determining states, and the turnover frequency (TOF) of any and all catalytic networks. By re-examining the concepts of chemical kinetics through rigorous mathematical treatment, an alternative definition is suggested for the term chemical mechanism. In addition, and in analogy to electrical circuits, the chemical resistor terms (called here kinestors) are identified for parallel and series chemical circuits, providing a new Ohmic interpretation for catalysis.

"Introduction: The accuracy of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology has not been fully validated in autopsied nonamnestic dementias. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated CSF amyloid beta 1-42, phosphorylated-tau, and amyloid-tau index as predictors of Alzheimer pathology in patients with primary progressive aphasia, frontotemporal dementia, and progressive supranuclear palsy. Results: Nineteen nonamnestic autopsied cases with relevant CSF values were included. At autopsy, nine had AD and 10 had non-AD pathologies. All six patients whose combined CSF phosphorylatedtau and amyloid b levels were consistent with AD had postmortem Alzheimer pathology. The two patients whose biomarker values were not consistent with AD had non-AD pathologies. The CSF values of the remaining eight non-AD cases were in conflicting or borderline ranges. Discussion: CSF biomarkers reliably identified Alzheimer pathology in nonamnestic dementias and may be useful as a screening measure for inclusion of nonamnestic cases into Alzheimer's trials.

"Grid-to-rod fretting (GTRF) in pressurized water reactors is a flow-induced vibration phenomenon that results in wear and fretting of the cladding material on fuel rods. GTRF is responsible for over 70% of the fuel failures in pressurized water reactors in the United States. Predicting the GTRF wear and concomitant interval between failures is important because of the large costs associated with reactor shutdown and replacement of fuel rod assemblies. The GTRF-induced wear process involves turbulent flow, mechanical vibration, tribology, and time-varying irradiated material properties in complex fuel assembly geometries. This paper presents a new approach for predicting GTRF induced fuel rod wear that uses high-resolution implicit large-eddy simulation to drive nonlinear transient dynamics computations. The GTRF fluid-structure problem is separated into the simulation of the turbulent flow field in the complex-geometry fuel-rod bundles using implicit large-eddy simulation, the calculation of statistics of the resulting fluctuating structural forces, and the nonlinear transient dynamics analysis of the fuel rod. Ultimately, the methods developed here, can be used, in conjunction with operational management, to improve reactor core designs in which fuel rod failures are minimized or potentially eliminated. Robustness of the behavior of both the structural forces computed from the turbulent flow simulations and the results from the transient dynamics analyses highlight the progress made towards achieving a predictive simulation capability for the GTRF problem.

"The program administrator and total cost of saved energy allow comparison of the cost of efficiency across utilities, states, and program types, and can identify potential performance improvements. Comparing program administrator cost with the total cost of saved energy can indicate the degree to which programs leverage investment by participants. Based on reported total costs and savings information for U.S. utility efficiency programs from 2009 to 2013, we estimate the savings-weighted average total cost of saved electricity across 20 states at $0.046 per kilowatt-hour (kW h), comparing favorably with energy supply costs and retail rates. Programs targeted on the residential market averaged $0.030 per kW h compared to $0.053 per kW h for nonresidential programs. Lighting programs, with an average total cost of $0.018 per kW h, drove lower savings costs in the residential market. We provide estimates for the most common program types and find that program administrators and participants on average are splitting the costs of efficiency in half. More consistent, standardized and complete reporting on efficiency programs is needed. Differing definitions and quantification of costs, savings and savings lifetimes pose challenges for comparing program results. Reducing these uncertainties could increase confidence in efficiency as a resource among planners and policymakers.

"The assessment and prevention of floods require appropriate forecasting and knowledge of the related hydrological processes. Due to the similar form of the governing equations, flood hydrograph shows a clear analytical and mathematical analogy with electrical circuits. In this paper, a spatially distributed hydrological model is developed which is analogue to a network of electrical resistance-capacitance with five circuits for describing the hydrological processes leading to floods. The spatially distributed hydrological model simulates rainfall, potential evapotranspiration, canopy interception, surface storage and soil storage. The parameters for analogical modelling were derived from translation of the physical catchment characteristics. A two-parameter Weibull equation aggregates the response functions of each pixel and calculates the hydrograph of the catchment. We applied the model to the 'Open-Book' or 'tilted V-catchment' theoretical benchmark problem, as well as to four hourly flood events and simulation of daily discharges. For the last two cases, data were used from the mountainous catchment of upper Tarqui in the Andes of Ecuador. Comparison of single versus multiple circuit designs for the benchmark problem indicates that the multiple circuit analogy provides a result similar to other hydrological models. The results further illustrate the usefulness of the methodology for flood modelling and how it can simplify the simulation for ungauged basins of temporal and spatial variations of influencing hydrological processes.

"Di(isononyl)cyclohexane-1,2-clicarboxylate(DINCH) is a major substitute for some high molecular weight phthalates that adversely affect reproductive function. Like for the phthalates a broad exposure of the population has to be expected. We postulated the DINCH monoester (MINCH) and secondary oxidized metabolites (OH-MINCH, cx-MINCH and oxo-MINCH) as human metabolites and possible biomarkers of DINCH exposure. We developed an on-line HPLC-MS/MS method for their determination in human urine. Identification was performed with authentic standard substances and quantification via isotope dilution. The analytical method is highly selective and sensitive with limits of quantification (LOQ) between 0.05 mu g/l and 0.1 mu g/l. In a pilot study with 22 volunteers from the general German population oxidized DINCH metabolites were found in above 80% of the samples. OH-MINCH was most abundant (mean 0.71 mu g/l; maximum 3.69 mu g/l) followed by cx-MINCH (0.61 mu g/l; 2.82 mu g/l) and oxo-MINCH (0.33 mu g/l: 1.05 mu g/l). All three oxidized metabolites correlated strongly among each other (rho >= 0.76). MINCH was detected in one sample only and has to be regarded a weak marker of exposure. With this analytical method we are able to perform human metabolism studies to provide metabolic conversion factors and to investigate the extent of DINCH exposure in the general population.

"Background: Recurrent respiratory tract infections (RRTIs) are the most common reason for children's visits to primary care physicians in France; however, little is known about general practitioners' (GPs) opinions and expectations concerning the management and prevention of these common and recurrent pathologies. Purpose: To describe French GPs' daily practice in the management of respiratory infections and the prevention of their recurrence in children. Methods: A sample group of French GPs answered a structured questionnaire on risk factors, RRTI management, antibiotic use and prevention measures. Results: A total of 358 GPs participated in the survey. Rhinopharyngitis, the most frequent respiratory infection, was considered to be recurrent if six or more episodes occurred in a year. Four risk factors were acknowledged as substantial: living in communities, passive smoking, pollution and allergies. Around 63% of GPs said that RRTIs are too often treated with antibiotics. More than 85% thought that prevention of RRTIs is possible. Smoking cessation, vaccination, allergen avoidance and hygiene were identified as the main preventive measures. A large majority of GPs (84%) prescribed products for prevention and similar to 90% would prescribe a product stimulating immunity if the efficacy and tolerability of these agents was proven and confirmed in their daily practice. Conclusions: French GPs are well aware of the health and socioeconomic burdens resulting from RRTIs, as well as the risk of antibiotic overuse. They have a prevention-oriented approach, implement preventive measures when possible and prescribe products for prevention.

"The goal of ubiquitous computing is to create ambience in which one's experiences and quality of life are improved by monitoring and assisting people using ubiquitous technologies and computation in coherence. The continuous advancements of involved technologies, such as wireless communications, mobile devices, and sensors, imply fast evolution of ubiquitous computing environments too. The complexity of these environments is reaching a point where traditional solutions simply no longer work. The environments are in need of computational techniques that can deal with the evolution and uncertainty of ubiquitous computing environments dynamically and automatically. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can contribute towards satisfying this future scenario in many ways, while numerous approaches inspired by work in the AI planning community have already been designed for ubiquitous computing. We devote this study to investigate the current progress of AI planning for ubiquitous computing by analysing those approaches. We rigorously search for and select relevant literature out of which we extract qualitative information. Using the extracted qualities, we derive a generic framework that consists of aspects important to planning for ubiquitous computing. The framework's main purpose is to facilitate the understanding of those aspects, and classify the literature according to them. We then analyse the literature in a consolidated way, and identify future challenges of planning for ubiquitous computing.

"Ample research demonstrated that empathizing with someone in need promotes helping that person. Two studies examined whether this effect of empathy on helping behavior holds across different emotional reactions expressed by a target in need. Results of Study 1 indicate that perspective taking with a sad needy target increased empathic concern which, in turn, fostered helping the individual. This relation was not found for participants taking the perspective of angry or disgusted needy targets. Study 2 provides further support for the underlying mechanism of the results of Study 1. Perspective taking with a sad needy target increased empathizers' empathic concern because perception of target neediness was increased. Again, this pattern was not found for perspective taking with an angry needy target. The findings correspond to theorizing on the role of emotions in person perception. Hence, the current research provides insights regarding the boundary conditions of the empathy-helping association.

"INTRODUCTION: Advanced air-flow limitation in patients with COPD leads to a reduction in vital capacity, respiratory muscle strength, and exercise capacity. However, its impact on chest and abdominal wall mobility is unknown. This study aimed to ascertain the prevalence of patients with COPD with reduced chest and abdominal wall mobility and to investigate the effect of reduced chest and abdominal wall mobility on pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength, and exercise capacity. METHODS: In 51 elderly male subjects with COPD, chest and abdominal wall mobility, FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, maximal inspiratory pressure (P-Imax), maximal expiratory pressure (P-Emax), and the 6-min walk distance (6MWD) were assessed. Chest and abdominal wall mobility were measured using the breathing movement scale (0-8) at the 3 regions (upper chest, lower chest, and abdomen). Reduced mobility was defined as a value lower than the lower limit of the normal scale. The unpaired t test, Mann-Whitney test, and multiple regression analysis were performed. RESULTS: The percentages of subjects with reduced mobility were 78% for the upper chest, 76% for the lower chest, and 53% for the abdomen. The subjects with reduced mobility had significantly low FVC, FEV1, and 6MWD in each region and significantly low FEV1/FVC, PImax, and PEmax in the abdominal region compared with those with nonreduced mobility. FVC and 6MWD were independently associated with the scale values in each region and with the abdominal scale value, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of subjects with COPD had reduced chest and abdominal wall mobility, which was independently associated with FVC. Even though abdominal wall mobility was relatively preserved compared with chest wall mobility, it was also independently associated with 6MWD.

"Human intervention studies have provided clear evidence that dietary polyphenols (eg, flavonoids-eg, flavonols-and isoflavones) are at least partly absorbed and that they have the potential to exert biological effects. Biological activity of polyphenols is often assessed by using cultured cells as tissue models; in almost all such studies, cells are treated with aglycones or polyphenol-rich extracts (derived from plants and foods), and data are reported at concentrations that elicited a response. There are 2 inherent flaws in such an approach. First, plasma and tissues are not exposed in vivo to polyphenols in these forms. Several human studies have identified the nature of polyphenol conjugates in vivo and have shown that dietary polyphenols undergo extensive modification during first-pass metabolism so that the forms reaching the blood and tissues are, in general, neither aglycones (except for green tea catechins) nor the same as the dietary source. Polyphenols are present as conjugates of glucuronate or sulfate, with or without methylation of the catechol functional group. As a consequence, the polyphenol conjugates are likely to possess different biological properties and distribution patterns within tissues and cells than do polyphenol aglycones. Although deconjugation can potentially occur in vivo to produce aglycone, it occurs only at certain sites. Second, the polyphenol concentrations tested should be of the same order as the maximum plasma concentrations attained after a polyphenol-rich meal, which are in the range of 0.1-10 mumol/L. For correct interpretation of results, future efforts to define biological activities of polyphenols must make use of the available data concerning bioavailability and metabolism in humans.

"Fastener assembly is a tedious and time-consuming work because operators have to check assembly manuals and find right fastener for each hole. Hence, this paper aims to develop a three-dimensional (3-D) projection system that projects assembly instruction onto the work piece surface directly to guide operators to assemble. However, in order to project the instruction accurately, the corresponding part of the computer-aided design model of the physical scanned area needs to be attained through the rapid and accurate registration. In order to achieve this goal, first, a high-accuracy and rapid 3-D measurement system is developed; second, a fast registration method based on local multiscale geometric feature vector is proposed to accelerate the registration speed and improve the registration reliability. Experimental results demonstrate the measurement accuracy of the developed system, and verify the feasibility of the proposed registration method. Hence, the proposed method can lead to improved assembly efficiency and decreased error probability, making great contributions to large-scale structure assembly.

"1. Vulnerability segmentation hypothesis proposes that plant branches are more resistant to cavitation than their terminal leaves, namely, the difference in vulnerability to cavitation between branches and their terminal leaves is positive (P50leaf-branch>0). This allows leaves to act as safety valves to protect hydraulic pathway from dysfunction. 2. Recent studies showed that several species from humid regions have negative values of P50leaf-branch, indicating a lack of vulnerability segmentation in these species (LVS species). 3. We hypothesize that compared with species from humid regions, vulnerability segmentation is critical and necessary for arid species to survive droughts, but LVS species may take compensatory hydraulic strategies to maintain safety margins during drought periods. 4. We compile branch and leaf hydraulic trait data of 69 broadleaved woody species belonging to different biomes with contrasting climatic conditions as indicated by variable aridity index (AI), and we find that P50leaf-branch becomes small and even negative with the increase of AI. Although leaves of LVS species may lose their function as safety valves, their deep rooting, great hydraulic conductivity, and/or high stem capacitance features are critical for them to maintain hydraulic safety. 5. The results indicate that vulnerability segmentation is evidently common for species from arid regions, but not necessarily the case for some species from humid regions. With robust cavitation-resistant leaves and effective hydraulic compensatory strategies, LVS species can maintain water supply and the functionality of leaves, thus giving them a hydraulic advantage over counterparts in the face of potential drought stress.

"Two-Dimensional finite element analysis was used to investigate the performance of seawall construction over weak subgrade soil using artificial base layer material consisted of cemented sand cushion comprising geosynthetics materials. Two types of base layer materials pure sand and cemented sand comprising husk rich ash and two types of geosynthetics materials geogrid and geotextile were used. Constitutive models were used to represent different materials in numerical analysis. The competence of two-dimensional numerical analysis was compared with experimental results. Numerical results showed a superior harmony with the experimental results. Finite element analysis model proved to be a great tool to determine the parameters that are difficult to measure in laboratory experiments. In addition, finite element analysis has the benefit of cost and time saving when compared to experimental investigation work. Numerical results showed strain induced in geosynthetics eliminated beyond a distance approximately equal six times of footing width.
