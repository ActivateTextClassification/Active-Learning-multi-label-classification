"Objective: Skeletal dysplasia with bowing long bones is a rare group of multiple characterized congenital anomalies. Materials and Methods: We introduce a simple, practical diagnostic flowchart that may be helpful in identifying the appropriate pathway of obstetrical management. Results: Herein, we describe four fetal cases of bent bony dysplasia that focus on ultrasound findings, phenotype, molecular tests, distinctive X-ray features, and chondral growth plate histology. The first case was a typical campomelic dysplasia resulting from a de novo mutation in the SOX9 gene. The second fetus was affected by osteogenesis imperfecta Type II carrying a mutation in the COLA1 gene. The third case was a rare presentation of campomelic dysplasia, Cumming type, in which SOX9 examination was normal. Subsequently, a femoral hypoplasia unusual fades syndrome is also discussed. Conclusion: Targeted molecular tests and genetic counseling are required for supplementing ultrasound imaging in order to diagnose the correct skeletal disorders.

"The spermatogenic cell-specific variant of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDS) has been cloned from a rat testis cDNA library and its pattern of expression determined. A 1,417 nucleotide cDNA has been found to encode an enzyme with substantial homology to mouse GAPDS (94% identity) and human GAPD2 (83% identity) isozymes. Northern blotting of rat tissue RNAs detected the 1.5 kb Gapds transcript in the testis and not in RNA from liver, spleen, epididymis, heart, skeletal muscle, brain, seminal vesicle, and kidney. The rat Gapds mRNA was first detected at day 29 of postnatal testis development, an age which coincides with the initial post-meiotic differentiation of round spermatids. When isolated rat spermatogenic cell RNA was probed for Gapds expression, transcripts were detected only in round spermatids and condensing spermatids, but not in pachytene spermatocytes, demonstrating haploid expression of the Gapds gene. However, immunohistochemical staining of rat testis sections with anti-GAPDS antisera did not detect GAPDS in round spermatids, but localized the protein only to stage XIII and later condensing spermatids as well as testicular spermatozoa, indicating that Gapds expression is translationally regulated. The current results are similar to those previously obtained for mouse GAPDS and human GAPD2, suggesting that reliable comparisons can be made between these species in toxicant screening and contraceptive development.

"Reciprocal signalling and gene expression play a cardinal role during pathogen-host molecular interactions and are prerequisite to the maintenance of balanced homeostasis. Gene expression repertoire changes during rickettsial infection and glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) were among the genes found up-regulated in Rickettsia-infected Dermacentor variabilis. GSTs are well known to play an important part in cellular stress responses in the host. We have cloned two full-length GSTs from D. variabilis (DvGST1 and DvGST2). Comparison of these two DvGST molecules with those of other species indicate that DvGST1 is related to the mammalian class theta and insect class delta GSTs, while DvGST2 does not seem to fall in the same family. Northern blotting analyses revealed differential expression patterns, where DvGST1 and DvGST2 transcripts are found in the tick gut, with DvGST2 transcripts also present in the ovaries. Both DvGST transcripts are up-regulated upon tick feeding. Challenge of fed adult ticks with Escherichia coli injection showed decreased transcript amounts compared with ticks injected with phosphate-buffered saline (sham) and naive ticks.

"Background: The effects of therapeutic relationship (TR) in elder mental health are understudied. A greater understanding of TR in geriatric psychotherapy is particularly needed for treating late-life depression with executive dysfunction, which predicts poor response to antidepressant medication and presents unique clinical challenges. Methods: Participants were older patients (N = 220) with major depression and executive dysfunction who received 12 weeks of problem-solving therapy or supportive therapy in a randomized control trial. Multilevel growth curve modeling and latent change scores were used to analyze TR dimensions of Understanding and Accepting at the patient level (individual patient ratings, N = 194) and therapist level (ratings of each therapist averaged across participants, N = 10). Results: TR predicted reduction of depression in both treatment groups, while treatment x TR interactions were not significant. Patients treated by therapists with higher average Understanding (patient and therapist level) and Accepting (therapist level) ratings had greater decreases in depression. The patient level x therapist level interaction for Understanding approached statistical significance (p=.065), suggesting a synergistic effect on treatment outcome. Together, Understanding and Accepting predicted 21% of variance in depression level changes. Limitations: TR was not assessed throughout the course of treatment (only after the first therapy session and at post-treatment) and did not include ratings from an objective evaluator. Conclusions: Assessment of patient's experience of the TR and of therapist ability to foster Understanding and Accepting can play a significant role in the delivery of geriatric psychosocial interventions.

"The pumped storage power station (PSPS) is a special power source that has flexible operation modes and multiple functions. With the rapid economic development in China, the energy demand and the peak-valley load difference of the power grid are continuing to increase. Moreover, wind power, nuclear power, and other new energy sources also develop very fast. Developing the PSPS is of great importance to the power source structure adjustment, and the secure and stable operation of the power grids in China in the 21st century. This paper provides a survey of the PSPS development in China. Over the last two decades, China's PSPS has developed quickly. The PSPS installed capacity had reached 21.83 gigawatts (GW) by the end of 2014, ranking among the top in the world. 27 PSPSs have been completed and put into production, and many with the installed capacity of more than 1200 megawatts (MW) are still under construction, including Fengning PSPS. In addition, a lot of sites suitable for the PSPS construction have been planned. With regard to the challenges existing in the exploitation course, some suggestions are proposed. There is a bright future for the PSPS development in China.

"The mu-opioid receptor (MOR) plays a mandatory role in the action of most opioid drugs, such as morphine, fentanyl, and heroin. it has been revealed that a deficiency in the MOR gene (Oprm 1) or a difference in the 3' noncoding region of the gene markedly affects the sensitivity of mice to opioids. As the 3' noncoding region of the human OPRM1 gene had not yet been characterized, in the present study we conducted 3'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3'RACE)-PCR and identified the 3' end of the human MOR-1 mRNA, the most abundant transcript among OPRM1 gene transcripts. The poly(A) signal was located at 13612-13617 nucleotides downstream from the stop codon in the OPRM1 gene. Reverse transcription PCR analyses showed that the region from the stop codon to the poly(A) signal was transcribed. In the 3' UTR, we identified 33 AU-rich regions and more than 300 putative transcription factor-binding sites. Furthermore, we compared the 3' noncoding regions of the human and mouse OPRM1/Oprm1] genes and found apparent homology. In Northern blotting with mouse brain mRNAs, a same-size band was detected by a probe for the MOR-1 coding region and by a probe for a mouse genome region corresponding to the human MOR-1 3'UTR. Since 3'UTRs affect gene expression, the present characterization of the 3' noncoding region in the human OPRM1 gene should lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying OPRM1 gene regulation and individual differences in sensitivity to opioids.

"Recurrent gene fusions involving EWSR1 with members of the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) family (ATF1 and CREB1) have been reported in a diverse group of tumors including angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma (AFH), soft tissue and gastrointestinal clear cell sarcoma, primary pulmonary myxoid sarcoma, and hyalinizing clear cell carcinoma of salivary gland. We have recently encountered a group of 5 myxoid mesenchymal tumors positive for EWSR1 fusions with one of the CREB family member (ATF1, CREB1, and CREM), with histologic features distinct from any of the previously described pathologic entities. Tumors occurred in children or young adults (12 to 23 y; mean, 18 y), with equal sex distribution. All except 1 were intracranial (intra-axial, 2; meningeal, 2), whereas 1 was perirectal. Histologically, the tumors were well circumscribed, often lobulated, composed of uniform ovoid to round cells, and arranged in cord-like or reticular structures in a myxoid background. All except 1 displayed unique sunburst amianthoid fibers. Immunohistochemically, tumors were positive for epithelial membrane antigen (5/5; 4 focal, 1 diffuse) and desmin (3/5). A novel EWSR1-CREM fusion was identified by RNA sequencing in the perirectal tumor, which was further confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A second case with similar EWSR1-CREM fusion was identified by RT-PCR and FISH in a meningeal tumor. The remaining cases studied by FISH showed the presence of EWSR1-CREB1 fusion in 2 cases and EWSR1-ATF1 in 1. In conclusion, we report a distinct group of myxoid mesenchymal neoplasms occurring in children or young adults with a predilection for intracranial locations. Although the immunoprofile [epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), desmin] and the fusion type raise the possibility of a myxoid AFH, none of the typical histologic findings of AFH were present, suggesting a novel entity.

"It has been shown in vitro that only specific dietary fibers contribute to immunity, but studies in vivo are not conclusive. Here, we investigated degree of polymerization (DP) dependent effects of beta 2 ->1-fructans on immunity via microbiota-dependent and-independent effects. To this end, conventional or germ-free mice received short-or long-chain beta 2 ->1-fructan for 5 days. Immune cell populations in the spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), and Peyer's patches (PPs) were analyzed with flow cytometry, genome-wide gene expression in the ileum was measured with microarray, and gut microbiota composition was analyzed with 16S rRNA sequencing of fecal samples. We found that beta 2 ->1-fructans modulated immunity by both microbiota and microbiota-independent effects. Moreover, effects were dependent on the chain-length of the beta 2 ->1-fructans type polymer. Both short-and long-chain beta 2 ->1-fructans enhanced T-helper 1 cells in PPs, whereas only short-chain beta 2 ->1-fructans increased regulatory T cells and CD11b(-)CD103(-)dendritic cells (DCs) in the MLN. A common feature after short-and long-chain beta 2 ->1-fructan treatment was enhanced 2-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase 2 expression and other IL-22-dependent genes in the ileum of conventional mice. These effects were not associated with shifts in gut microbiota composition, or altered production of short-chain fatty acids. Both short-and long-chain beta 2 ->1-fructans also induced immune effects in germ-free animals, demonstrating direct effect independent from the gut microbiota. Also, these effects were dependent on the chain-length of the beta 2 ->1-fructans. Short-chain beta 2 ->1-fructan induced lower CD80 expression by CD11b(-)CD103(-) DCs in PPs, whereas long-chain beta 2 ->1-fructan specifically modulated B cell responses in germ-free mice. In conclusion, support of immunity is determined by the chemical structure of beta 2 ->1-fructans and is partially microbiota independent.

"BACKGROUND: Characterizing associations between the upper and lower airways is important for asthma management. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the determinants of incomplete asthma control in patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma. METHODS: Multiple factors including age, sex, atopy, smoking history, medication use, Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) score, FEV1, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (F-ENO), and rhinitis questionnaire score were examined. AR was defined by rhinitis symptoms and the sensitization to inhaled allergens. ACQ was used to dichotomize the subjects into the incompletely controlled group (ACQ score >= 0.75) and the well-controlled group. The factors that contribute to incomplete asthma control were assessed by a multivariate analysis. RESULTS: A total of 260 patients with AR and asthma were enrolled and 108 patients (42%) were classified as incomplete asthma control. The incompletely controlled group was older (P<.05), and had more airflow limitation, more airway inflammation, and more severe rhinitis symptoms (all P<.001). In contrast, the well-controlled group was more likely to be taking nasal corticosteroids (NCSs) (P<.01). In a multivariate model adjusted by age, asthma treatment, airflow limitation, and FENO, persistence and severity of rhinitis (odds ratio [OR], 2.57; 95% CI, 1.41-4.70, and OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.10-3.65) and nonuse of NCSs (OR, 3.83; 95% CI, 1.50-9.81) were independently associated with incomplete asthma control. CONCLUSIONS: The persistence and severity of AR and the use of NCSs were associated with the level of asthma control in patients with AR and asthma. Further studies are required to determine whether appropriate treatment of rhinitis would improve asthma control. (C) 2016 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology

"Many epidemical and biological studies have proposed that human papillomavirus (HPV), primarily high-risk HPV16/18, is an etiological factor for a subset of head and neck (HN) cancers. On that premise, we systematically reviewed relevant articles and improved the understanding of HPV-related cancers. This article comprehensively described the characteristics of HPV-associated HN tumors according to demography, histopathology, molecular biology, and prognosis. Meta-analyses were conducted to combine the studies that reported the association between HPV status and these variables using Rev Man 5.0. The pooled results showed that HPV-positive tumors were not only poorly differentiated (OR = 2.77, 95% CI: 2.3-3.32) and smaller (OR = 2.21, 95% CI: 1.75-2.8) but were also strongly associated with oropharynx (OR = 5.8, 95% CI: 4.01-8.38) and node involvement (OR = 2.77, 95% CI: 2.3-3.32). HPV-related tumors showed significantly more p16 overexpression (OR = 34.55, 95% CI: 20.91-57.09) and less TP53 mutations (OR = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.18-0.41) than HPV-negative tumors. The patients with HPV-positive cancers had different clinical behaviors, such as a reduced risks of death (HR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.29-0.36). This study supported the view point that HPV is a favorable indicator of prognosis and that HPV-related HN tumors are distinct from traditional tumors. This etiological relationship could impact future strategies of diagnosis, prevention, therapy, and prognosis for this subset of patients. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs involved in fine-tuning of gene regulation. Antisense oligonucleotides (ONs) are promising tools as anti-miRNA (anti-miR) agents toward therapeutic applications and to uncover miRNA function. Such anti-miR ONs include 2'-O-methyl (OMe), cationic peptide nucleic acids like K-PNA-K3, and locked nucleic acid (LNA)-based anti-miRs such as LNA/DNA or LNA/OMe. Northern blotting is a widely used and robust technique to detect miRNAs. However, miRNA quantification in the presence of anti-miR ONs has proved to be challenging, due to detection artifacts, which has led to poor understanding of miRNA fate upon anti-miR binding. Here we show that anti-miR ON bound to miR-122 can prevent the miRNA from being properly precipitated into the purified RNA fraction using the standard RNA extraction protocol (TRI-Reagent), yielding an RNA extract that does not reflect the real cellular levels of the miRNA. An increase in the numbers of equivalents of isopropanol during the precipitation step leads to full recovery of the targeted miRNA back into the purified RNA extract. Following our improved protocol, we demonstrate by Northern blotting, in conjunction with a PNA decoy strategy and use of high denaturing PAGE, that high-affinity anti-miRs (K-PNA-K3, LNA/DNA, and LNA/OMe) sequester miR-122 without causing miRNA degradation, while miR-122 targeting with a lower-affinity anti-miR (OMe) seems to promote degradation of the miRNA. The technical issues explored in this work will have relevance for other hybridization-based techniques for miRNA quantification in the presence of anti-miR ONs.

"This paper investigates the impact of stock market developments on oil and electricity demand of OECD member countries. We conduct different panel data methodologies and use annual data ranging from 1996 to 2011. The overall findings substantiate that income, real prices, size of the stock market and liquidity are important determinants for both oil and electricity demand. We also compute long-run elasticity coefficients by using a simple Partial Adjustment Model (PAM) and find that the long run elasticity coefficients are larger than the short run parameters. Moreover, our results show that the demand for oil and electricity is inelastic with respect to both own real price and real income over the short-run and the long-run. From a policy making perspective, the findings suggest that potential policy tools to reduce energy consumption may not be useful as the demand for energy is inelastic with respect to energy prices. Our results also manifest that although stock market deepening variables do not have a large effect on energy use as energy price and economic growth have, market size and liquidity significantly affect energy consumption. Therefore, energy demand estimations based on solely energy price and income may be inaccurate when some stock market development indicators are excluded. The empirical findings of this paper provide further insights for policy makers, energy companies and energy economists in terms of demand management policies and pricing decisions.

"Human brain asymmetries have been well described. Intriguingly, a number of asymmetries in brain phenotypes have been shown to change throughout the lifespan. Recent studies have revealed topological asymmetries between hemispheric white matter networks in the human brain. However, it remains unknown whether and how these topological asymmetries evolve from adolescence to young adulthood, a critical period that constitutes the second peak of human brain and cognitive development. To address this question, the present study included a large cohort of healthy adolescents and young adults. Diffusion and structural magnetic resonance imaging were acquired to construct hemispheric white matter networks, and graph-theory was applied to quantify topological parameters of the hemispheric networks. In both adolescents and young adults, rightward asymmetry in both global and local network efficiencies was consistently observed between the 2 hemispheres, but the degree of the asymmetry was significantly decreased in young adults. At the nodal level, the young adults exhibited less rightward asymmetry of nodal efficiency mainly around the parasylvian area, posterior tempo-parietal cortex, and fusiform gyrus. These developmental patterns of network asymmetry provide novel insight into the human brain structural development from adolescence to young adulthood and also likely relate to the maturation of language and social cognition that takes place during this period.

"No specific pathognomonic tissue changes establish death from water intoxication, which makes a postmortem diagnosis of water intoxication difficult. We report an autopsy case of fatal water intoxication in which the postmortem computed tomography (PMCT) examination showed findings suggestive of antemortem excessive water drinking, such as diluted intestinal contents and hemodilution. A 52-year-old man who had schizophrenia was found dead in his house. He frequently complained of polydipsia, and drank a large amount of water and vomited before his death. PMCT findings showed distention of the duodenum with low radiodensity content (7 HU). In addition, the right atrium showed a low radiodensity content (46 HU). Autopsy results showed moderate congestion in all the organs, a large amount of light-brownish liquid in the duodenum and upper jejunum, and aspiration pneumonia. Electrolyte concentrations of sodium in the vitreous humor of the right and left eyes were 105 and 107 mEq/L, respectively, and neither drugs nor alcohol was detected in the blood. On the basis of the autopsy and biochemical findings, we determined water intoxication as the cause of death. An evaluation of PMCT findings of cases of various causes of death indicated that the radiodensities of the right atrium and duodenal content in our case were lower than those of the cases of various causes of death, except for fresh water drowning. The present case showed that PMCT provides supplementary findings regarding antemortem excessive water drinking. In addition, PMCT may provide findings to consider death from water intoxication before autopsy.

"Rearing in darkness slows the time course of the visual cortical critical period, such that at 5 weeks of age normal cats are more plastic than dark-reared cats, while at 20 weeks dark-reared cats are more plastic [Mower GD (1991) The effect of dark rearing on the time course of the critical period in cat visual cortex. Dev Brain Res 58:151-158]. Thus, genes that are important for visual cortical plasticity should show differences in expression between normal and darkreared visual cortex that are of opposite direction in young versus older animals. Previously, we showed by differential display polymerase chain reaction and northern blotting that mRNA for Munc13-3, a mammalian homologue of the C. elegans uncoordinated (unc) gene, shows such bidirectional regulation in cat visual cortex [Yang CB, Zheng YT, Li GY, Mower GD (2002) Identification of Munc13-3 as a candidate gene for critical period neuroplasticity in visual cortex. J Neurosci 22:8614-8618]. Here, the analysis is extended to Munc13-3protein in mouse visual cortex, which will provide the basis for gene manipulation analysis. In mice, Munc13-3 protein was elevated 2.3-fold in dark-reared compared with normal visual cortex at 3.5 weeks and 2.0-fold in normal compared with dark-reared visual cortex at 9.5 weeks. Analysis of variance of protein levels showed a significant interaction, indicating that the effect of dark rearing depended on age. This bidirectional regulation was restricted to visual cortex and did not occur in frontal cortex. Bidirectional regulation was also specific to Munc13-3 and was not found for other Munc13 family members. Munc13 proteins serve a central priming function in synaptic vesicle exocytosis at glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses and this work contributes to the growing evidence indicating a role of Munc13 genes in synaptic plasticity.

"The objective of this study was to assess the sensitivity of the Omni Klentaq-LA DNA polymerase for detecting Aleutian mink disease virus (AMDV) in mink blood and tissues by PCR without DNA extraction. The presence of AMDV DNA was directly tested by Klentaq in the plasma, serum, whole blood, and spleen homogenates of 188 mink 4 and 16 months after inoculation with the virus. Samples from bone marrow, small intestine, liver, lungs, kidneys, and lymph nodes of 20 of the same mink were also tested by Klentaq. DNA was extracted from paired samples of plasma and the aforesaid tissues by a commercial nucleic acid extraction kit (Dynabeads Silane) and tested by PCR. Compared with the extracted DNA, Klentaq detected a significantly greater number of samples in the whole blood, serum, plasma, spleen, and small intestine. It was concluded that Klentaq is a preferred system for directly detecting AMDV DNA in mink blood and tissues. The lower success rate of extracted DNA compared with Klentaq could be the result of DNA losses during the extraction process. This is an important factor in chronically infected mink, which have a low AMDV copy number in the bloodstream. Direct AMDV detection also reduces the cost of PCR amplification and lowers the risk of sample contamination.

"The aims were to evaluate the levels of bacterial species in saliva and in situ and to assess whether the design of brackets influences the risk of developing periodontal disease. Twenty patients (13.3 mean age) were bonded with self-ligating brackets and a conventional bracket. Saliva was collected before bonding and 30 and 60 days after bonding. One sample of each bracket was removed 30 and 60 days after bonding. The analysis was determined by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. The data was evaluated by the non-parametric test. A significant increase in the levels of bacterial species in the saliva occurred in 15 of the 22 analyzed species. The self-ligating brackets presented the highest incidence percentages for the orange and red complexes 60 days after bonding. In situ analyses showed different patterns according to the bracket design. The levels of Campylobacter rectus showed significant differences (p = 0.011) 60 days after bonding among the three brackets; the highest values were observed in the In-OvationA (R) R bracket. The bracket design seems to influence the levels of bacterial species involved in periodontal disease. Considering the wide variety of bacterial species, additional studies are needed to aid in the establishment of effective protocols to prevent the development of periodontal disease during orthodontic treatment. A dynamic alteration in the oral microbiota may lead to inflammatory reactions in the supporting soft and hard tissues. The different types of brackets interfere with bacterial adherence. Bracket design should be considered in orthodontic treatment.

"One of the possible research lines for improving the Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) technology is the enhancement of the thermophysical properties of the Heat Transfer Fluids (HTF) used. This enhancement leads to reduce costs for producing electricity using this technology. So, this study presents the preparation of nanofluids in which Ag nanoparticles were added to a base fluid composed of a eutectic mixture of diphenyl oxide and biphenyl. The base fluid is a heat transfer fluid commonly used in concentrating solar power plants. The nanofluids were shown to have improved thermal properties, the heat transfer coefficient increasing by up to 6% compared with the base fluid. Thus, their use could lead to enhancements in the overall efficiency of CSP plants. Accordingly, nanofluids were prepared with varying nanoparticle concentrations and their properties were characterized, including their physical and chemical stability, viscosity, isobaric specific heat and thermal conductivity. In addition, molecular dynamic calculations were performed to reach a better understanding of the nanofluid system at a molecular level. The isobaric specific heat and thermal conductivity values followed the same experimental tendency. An analysis of the radial distribution functions (RDFs) and spatial distribution functions (SDFs) shows that there is a first layer of base fluid molecules around the metal in which the oxygen atoms play an important role. This first layer encourages the directionality of the movement in the heart of the nanofluid, which leads to enhanced thermal properties. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"BackgroundHigh levels of maltreatment are found in children who are identified because their parents visit the emergency department due to partner violence, substance abuse or suicide attempt. However, it is unknown if these children experience psychosocial problems. This study aims to assess their levels of post-traumatic stress, anxiety, depression, behavioural problems and health-related quality of life. MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted in six hospitals. All consecutive families of which a parent visited the emergency department due to partner violence, substance abuse or suicide attempt between 1 July 2012 and 1 March 2014 with children aged 1.5-17years were approached for participation. Parents and children aged 8years and older filled out questionnaires measuring post-traumatic stress [13-item version of Children's Revised Impact of Event Scale (CRIES-13)], anxiety, depression (Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale), behavioural problems [Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Youth Self-Report (YSR)] and health-related quality of life (PedsQL). Scores of participants were compared with reference data obtained in children in similar age ranges from representative Dutch community samples (CRIES-13, Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale, PedsQL and CBCL) and to a normed cutoff score (CRIES-13). ResultsOf 195 eligible families, 89 (46%) participated in the study. Participating children did not score different from community children, both on child-reported and parent-reported instruments. Standardized mean differences of total sum scores were 0 (CRIES-13 and CBCL 1.5-5), 0.1 (YSR), 0.2 (CBCL 6-18) and -0.3 (PedsQL) and not statistically different from community children. Thirty-five percent of the participating children scored above the cutoff score on the CRIES-13, indicating post-traumatic stress disorder, but this difference was not statistically significant from community children (mean difference 8%; 95% CI -4-22%). ConclusionsWe found no differences in psychosocial problems between children whose parents visited the emergency department due to partner violence, substance abuse or suicide attempt and children from community samples. Because 35% of the children scored in the range of post-traumatic stress disorder, we advise healthcare providers to pay attention to post-traumatic stress symptoms

"Fiber optical gyro (FOG) is a kind of solid-state optical gyroscope with good environmental adaptability, which has been widely used in national defense, aviation, aerospace and other civilian areas. In some applications, FOG will experience environmental conditions such as vacuum, radiation, vibration and so on, and the scale-factor performance is concerned as an important accuracy indicator. However, the scale-factor performance of FOG under these environmental conditions is difficult to test using conventional methods, as the turntable can't work under these environmental conditions. According to the phenomenon that the physical effects of FOG produced by the sawtooth voltage signal under static conditions is consistent with the physical effects of FOG produced by a turntable in uniform rotation, a new method for the scale-factor performance test of FOG without turntable is proposed in this paper. In this method, the test system of the scale-factor performance is constituted by an external operational amplifier circuit and a FOG which the modulation signal and Y waveguied are disconnected. The external operational amplifier circuit is used to superimpose the externally generated sawtooth voltage signal and the modulation signal of FOG, and to exert the superimposed signal on the Y waveguide of the FOG. The test system can produce different equivalent angular velocities by changing the cycle of the sawtooth signal in the scale-factor performance test. In this paper, the system model of FOG superimposed with an externally generated sawtooth is analyzed, and a conclusion that the effect of the equivalent input angular velocity produced by the sawtooth voltage signal is consistent with the effect of input angular velocity produced by the turntable is obtained. The relationship between the equivalent angular velocity and the parameters such as sawtooth cycle and so on is presented, and the correction method for the equivalent angular velocity is also presented by analyzing the influence of each parameter error on the equivalent angular velocity. A comparative experiment of the method proposed in this paper and the method of turntable calibration was conducted, and the scale-factor performance test results of the same FOG using the two methods were consistent. Using the method proposed in this paper to test the scale-factor performance of FOG, the input angular velocity is the equivalent effect produced by a sawtooth voltage signal, and there is no need to use a turntable to produce mechanical rotation, so this method can be used to test the performance of FOG at the ambient conditions which turntable can not work.

"Although open-mindedness is generally valued, people are not equally open-minded in all situations. Open-mindedness is viewed as socially desirable when individuals encounter viewpoints that are compatible with conventional social norms. However, open-mindedness is viewed in less desirable terms when individuals encounter viewpoints that undermine these norms. The perceived desirability of open-mindedness is also influenced by the individual's personal attitudinal convictions. Individuals inflate' the normative appropriateness of open-mindedness when it serves to reinforce their convictions, but devalue the normative appropriateness of open-mindedness when it serves to contradict these convictions. Conversely, normative prohibition of closed-mindedness is exaggerated when a closed-minded orientation threatens the individual's personal attitudinal convictions, but is minimized (or reversed) when a closed-minded orientation reinforces these convictions. Paradoxically, the perceived appropriateness of open-mindedness is engendered (at least in part) by the motivation to confirm one's prior attitudinal convictions. Evidence of this attitude justification effect is obtained in two experiments.

"ObjectiveEstablish whether inflammatory biomarkersserum amyloid A (SAA), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-)are related to key symptoms of depression, including anxiety and fatigue, in a cross-sectional, out-patient setting to identify biomarkers that reflect psychiatric symptomatology in a naturalistic, real-life population. MethodsWe measured SAA, CRP, IL-6, and TNF- in plasma samples from 89 adult psychiatric out-patients by multiplex, high-sensitivity electrochemiluminescent assays. Psychiatric symptoms were evaluated using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). ResultsPlasma SAA was most robustly associated with depressive symptoms across diagnostic boundaries in this cohort of out-patients. Elevated SAA was significantly associated with higher total scores on the HAMD-17 scale and correlated with multiple scale items that rated symptoms of fatigue and depressed mood, but not with anxiety-related items. ConclusionsSAA might constitute a cross-diagnostic marker indicative of depressed mood and fatigue in a naturalistic patient setting. Because SAA activates Toll-like receptors 2 and 4, present on macrophages and glial cells, its association with depression severity could also implicate this inflammatory mediator in the pathogenesis of mood disorders.

Molecular probes are used to target discrete biological processes such as cell death, inflammation, and angiogenesis. These probes emit signals that are detected by traditional imaging systems. Because the same disease processes can manifest in individuals in different ways, molecular imaging may emerge as an important strategy for delivering precision medicine. Summary Molecular imaging is a powerful tool that may help physicians provide more personalized care in the near future.

"Peyronie's disease (PD) is a localized disorder of the connective tissue of the tunica albuginea (TA) whose etiology has not been elucidated. Although several studies have implicated genetic susceptibility and/or mechanical trauma as triggering events for PD, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Aquaporin 1 (AQP1) is a water channel protein potentially implicated in connective tissue resistance to mechanical stress, acting primarily by increasing tension within the collagen network. Although it represents a potentially attractive molecular target in PD, to date no studies had ever addressed whether AQP1 is detectable and/or differentially expressed in the TA of these patients. Herein the present study, through immunohistochemical and biochemical approaches, we were able to detect AQP1 expression in the TA of control and PD affected patients. We demonstrated that AQP1-like immunoreactivity and expression are significantly increased in plaques of PD patients Vs controls, implying that AQP1 overexpression might be the consequence of a localized maladaptive response of the connective tissue to repeated mechanical trauma. In summary, these data support the idea that AQP1 might represent a potentially useful biomarker of mechanical injury in the TA and a promising target for the treatment of PD.

"Rotavirus A (RVA) causes acute diarrhea in children as well as animals. As part of a crosssectional study of children less than 5 years of age hospitalized for acute diarrhea in Vietnam during a 15-month period (2007-2008), 322 (43.5%) of 741 fecal specimens contained RVA with 92% either G1P[8] or G3P[8]. This study was undertaken to further characterize strains that remained untypeable to complete the G and P genotypes of the 322 rotavirus-positive specimens. While 307 (95.3%) strains possessed the common human RVA genotypes: G1P[8] (45.0%), G2P[4] (2.8%), G3P[8] (46.9%), and G9P[8] (0.6%), sequencing of initially untypeable specimens revealed the presence of two unusual strains designated NT0073 and NT0082 possessing G9P[19] and G10P[14], respectively. The genotype constellation of NT0073 (G9-P[19]-I5-R1-C1-M1-A8-N1-T7-E1-H1) and the phylogenetic trees suggested its origin as a porcine RVA strain causing diarrhea in a 24-month-old girl whereas the genotype constellation of NT0082 (G10-P[14]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A3N2- T6-E2-H3) and the phylogenetic trees suggested its origin as an RVA strain of artiodactyl origin (such as cattle, sheep and goats) causing diarrhea in a 13-month-old boy. This study showed that RVA strains of animal host origin were not necessarily attenuated in humans. A hypothesis may be postulated that P[19] and P[14] VP4 spike proteins helped the virus to replicate in the human intestine but that efficient onward human-to-human spread after crossing the host species barrier may require the virus to obtain some additional features as there was no evidence of widespread transmission with the limited sampling performed over the study period.

"Radish (Raphanus sativus L) is cultivated worldwide and is of agronomic importance. dsRNAs associated with partitiviruses were previously found in many R. sativus varieties. In this study, three large dsRNAs from radish were cloned using a modified single primer amplification technique. These three dsRNAs of lengths 3638, 3517 and 3299 bp shared conserved untranslated terminal regions, and each contained a major open reading frame putatively encoding the chrysoviral replicase, capsid protein and protease respectively. Isometric virus-like particles (VIP), approximately 45 nm in diameter, were isolated from the infected radish plants. Northern blotting indicated that these dsRNAs were encapsidated in the VLP. The virus containing these dsRNA genome segments was named Raphanus sativus chrysovirus 1 (RasCV1). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that RasCV1 is a new species of the Chrysoviridae family and forms a plant taxon with another putative plant chrysovirus, Anthurium mosaic-associated virus (AmaCV). Furthermore, no fungal mycelia were observed in radish leaf tissues stained with trypan blue. These results indicated that RasCV1 is most likely a plant chrysovirus rather than a chrysovirus in symbiotic fungi. An exhaustive BLAST analysis of RasCV1 and AmaCV revealed that chrysovirus-like viruses might widely exist in eudicot and monocot plants and that endogenization of chrysovirus segments into plant genome might have ever happened.

"Glioma is the most common primary malignant tumor of the central nervous system, which results in both a poor prognosis and outcome because of the aggressive progression of disease, growth and resistance to surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. MiR-140-5p is a small, non-coding single-stranded RNA molecule, which was previously studied in the settings of human tongue cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and colorectal cancer. However, detailed data that formally demonstrate the contribution of miR-140-5p to glioma development are missing. Similarly, relatively little is known about the relationship of miR-140-5p, vascular endothelial growth factor A, and matrix metalloproteinase-2 in glioma progression. In this study, we found that miR-140-5p expression was significantly decreased in glioma tissues and in the glioma cell-lines U87 and U251 as compared with non-cancerous brain tissues by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. In addition, miR-140-5p inhibited glioma cell proliferation and invasion and promoted glioma cell apoptosis both in vivo and in vitro. Interestingly, while the expression levels of miR-140-5p were higher in glioma cells, the messenger RNA or protein expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor A and matrix metalloproteinase-2 were lower in glioma cells as determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blot assay, and immunohistochemistry. By contrast, downregulation in the expression levels of miR-140-5p augmented the messenger RNA and protein expression levels of both vascular endothelial growth factor A and matrix metalloproteinase-2. These findings suggested that miR-140-5p inhibited glioma proliferation and invasion by regulating the vascular endothelial growth factor A/matrix metalloproteinase-2 signaling pathway both in vitro and in vivo.

"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with atypical cortical maturation leading to a deficiency in social cognition and language. Numerous studies have attempted to classify ASD using brain measurements such as cortical thickness, surface area, or volume with promising results. However, the underpowered sample sizes of these studies limit external validity and generalizability at the population level. Large scale collaborations such as Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta Analysis (ENIGMA) or the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) aim to bring together like-minded scientists to further improve investigations into brain disorders. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the largest classification analysis for detection of ASD vs. healthy age and sex matched controls using cortical thickness brain parcellations and intracranial volume normalized surface area and subcortical volumes. We were able to increase classification accuracy overall from 56% to 60% and for females only by 6%. These novel findings using Evolving Partitions to Improve Connectomics (EPIC) underscore the importance of large-scale data-driven approaches and collaborations in the discovery of brain disorders.

"The paper aims at explaining why large-scale energy-intensive industries-here the German iron and steel industry-had a period of slow uptake of major energy-efficient technologies from the mid 1990s to mid 2000s (Arens and Worrell, 2014) and why from the mid 2000s onwards these technologies are increasingly implemented again. We analyze the underlying factors and investment/innovation behavior of individual firms in the German iron and steel industry to better understand barriers and drivers for technological change. The paper gives insights on the decision-making process on energy efficiency in firms and helps to understand how policy affects decision-making. We use a mixed method approach. First, we analyze the diffusion of three energy-efficient technologies (EET) for primary steelmaking from their introduction until today (top-pressure recovery turbine (TRT), basic oxygen furnace gas recovery (BOFGR), and pulverized coal injection (PCI)). We derive the uptake of these technologies both at the national level and at the level of the individual firm. Second, we analyze the impact of drivers and barriers on the decision-making process of individual firms whether or not they want to implement these technologies. Economics and access to capital are the foremost barriers to the uptake of an EET. If the expected payback period exceeds a certain value or if the company lacks capital, investments in EET seem not to happen. But even if an EET is economically viable and the company has access to capital, investments in EET might not be realized. Policy-induced prices might have strengthened the recent diffusion of TRT. We found indications that in a limited number of cases, policy intervention was a driving factor. Technical risks and imperfect information are only marginal factors in our cases. Site-specific factors seem to be important, as site-specific factors shape the economics of the selected EET.

"Some species of the Arcobacter genus are considered emerging foodborne and waterborne en. However, the presence of Arcobacter spp. in vegetables very little is known, because most studies have focused on foods of animal origin. On the other hand, quinolones are considered as first-line drugs for the treatment of infection by campylobacteria in human patients, but few data are currently available about the resistance levels to these antibiotics among Arcobacter species. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the presence and diversity of arcobacters isolated from fresh vegetables such as lettuces, spinaches, chards and cabbages. Resistance to quinolones of the isolates was also investigated. One hundred fresh vegetables samples purchased from seven local retail markets in Valencia (Spain) during eight months were analysed. The study included 41 lettuces, 21 spinaches, 34 chards and 4 cabbages. Samples were analysed by culture and by molecular methods before and after enrichment. By culture, 17 out of 100 analysed samples were Arcobacter positive and twenty-five isolates were obtained from them. Direct detection by PCR was low, with only 4% Arcobacter spp. positive samples. This percentage increased considerably, up 20%, after 48 h enrichment. By polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), 17 out of the 25 isolates were identified as A. butzleri and 8 as A. cryaerophilus. Only two A. butzleri isolates showed resistance to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. The sequencing of a fragment of the QRDR region of the gyrA gene from the quinolones-resistant isolates revealed the presence of a mutation in position 254 of this gene (C-T transition). This study is the first report about the presence of pathogenic species of Arcobacter spp. in chards and cabbages and confirms that fresh vegetables can act as transmission vehicle to humans. Moreover, the presence of A. butzleri quinolone resistant in vegetables could pose a potential public health risk. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"Prior work shows that children selectively learn from credible speakers. Yet little is known how they treat information from non-credible speakers. This research examined to what extent and under what conditions children may or may not learn from problematic sources. In three studies, we found that children displayed trust toward previously inaccurate speakers. Children were equally likely to extend labels from previously accurate and inaccurate speakers to novel objects. Moreover, they expected third parties to share labels provided by previously inaccurate speakers. Only when there was clear evidence that the speakers' information was wrong (as in the case when speakers' perceptual access to the information was blocked), did young children reject the label. Together, the findings provide evidence that young children do not completely ignore the labels supplied by non-credible speakers unless there is strong reason to do so.

"A novel weak capacitance measurement system is proposed to measure the gas-solid two-phase flows. The system is mainly consist of capacitance sensor, Micro-programmed Control Unit (MCU), Direct Digital Synthesizer (DDS), operational amplifier, analogue multiplier and low-pass filter. Since the stray capacitance is much larger than the variation of measured capacitance, the stray capacitance should be eliminate by the measurement system. The experimental results show that the system meets the application requirement, and has good linearity, high measurement accuracy and stray-immune. The result of the percentage error is about 0.6% and the non-linear error is less than 1.5%. The sampling rate which is related to the frequency of the signal generator and the MCU clock can reach 500 kps.

"Nano-fibrillated cellulose (NFC), an abundant renewable bio-macromolecule, has received much attention in the research community. The study detailed herein is related to the preparation of photocatalytic nanocomposites consisting of nano-fibrillated cellulose/magnetite/titanium dioxide nanoparticles (NFC@Fe3O4@TNP). The aim of this study is to improve the photocatalytic efficiency of NFC-TNP composites and to improve their recyclability during the photocatalytic hydrogen generation. The NFC@Fe3O4@TNP nanocomposites were characterized by TEM, EDX, SAED, XRD, XPS, FTIR, Raman spectra and VSM techniques, The results showed that Fe3O4 NP and TNP were Well-distributed on the surface of NFC. The photocatalytic efficiency study showed that NFC@Fe3O4@TNP nanocomposites represented a higher photocatalytic hydrogen generation rate in comparison with that of NFC-TNP sample. In addition, the NFC@Fe3O4@TNP nanocomposites can be readily recovered from the system using a magnet due to their stable superparamagnetic properties, and they had only a marginal loss of TNP and photocatalytic efficiency after fifteen cycles.

"This paper identifies several directions to improve the performances of the operating mechanism for medium voltage circuit breakers in order to get variable moving characteristics of the moving contact adjusted to the value of the switching current. Different drive solutions currently used in the operation of vacuum circuit breakers and SF6 were analyzed comparatively, as well as the performances they have to meet depending on the application. The solution proposes the use of a system with a microprocessor able to independently control the operation of moving contacts by stepper motors and the acquisition of the circuit breaker functional parameters.

"Gas sensors play a vital role on many aspects in our society, and have gained much progress, propelled by the development of nanoscience and nanotechnology. In this regard, metal oxides with heterojunctions have attracted tremendous attention owing to their enhanced gas sensing properties. Herein, belt-tooth shape ZnO/In2O3 nano-heterostructures has been achieved through a chemical vapor deposition process. The gas sensor fabricated from the as-prepared nano-heterostructures exhibits superior sensing performances for C2H2 gas at low operating temperature (90 degrees C). Moreover, the Au decorated ZnO/In2O3 nano-heterostructures (Au-ZnO/In2O3) exhibit enhanced C2H2 sensing properties such as higher response, less response time, better selectivity and smaller deviation from the ideal value of power exponent. More significantly, the response to C2H2 gas is maintained well in 30 days, indicating good long-term stability. In addition, both the potential-barrier-controlled carrier transport model combining with the surface depletion model and the unique properties of Au are presented to describe the C2H2 gas sensing mechanism of Au-ZnO/In2O3. This study offers an innovative methodology to design novel gas sensing materials and enhance gas sensing performances. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"Aim: To investigate the action of isothiafludine (NZ-4), a derivative of bis-heterocycle tandem pairs from the natural product leucamide A, on the replication cycle of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in vitro and in vivo. Methods: HBV replication cycle was monitored in HepG2.2.15 cells using qPCR, qRT-PCR, and Southern and Northern blotting. HBV protein expression and capsid assembly were detected using Western blotting and native agarose gel electrophoresis analysis. The interaction of pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) and the core protein was investigated by RNA immunoprecipitation. To evaluate the anti-HBV effect of NZ-4 in vivo, DHBV-infected ducks were orally administered NZ-4 (25, 50 or 100 mg.kg(-1).d(-1)) for 15 d. Results: NZ-4 suppressed intracellular HBV replication in HepG2.2.15 cells with an IC50 value of 1.33 mu mol/L, whereas the compound inhibited the cell viability with an IC50 value of 50.4 mu mol/L. Furthermore, NZ-4 was active against the replication of various drug-resistant HBV mutants, including 3TC/ETV-dual-resistant and ADV-resistant HBV mutants. NZ-4 (5, 10, and 20 mu mol/L) concentration-dependently reduced the encapsidated HBV pgRNA, resulting in the assembly of replication-deficient capsids in HepG2.2.15 cells. Oral administration of NZ-4 dose-dependently inhibited DHBV DNA replication in the DHBV-infected ducks. Conclusion: NZ-4 inhibits HBV replication by interfering with the interaction between pgRNA and HBcAg in the capsid assembly process, thus increasing the replication-deficient HBV capsids. Such mechanism of action might provide a new therapeutic strategy to combat HBV infection.

"The present study examines the molecular mechanism underlying in vitro-induced resistance to FLC (fluconazole), KTC (ketaonazole), MCZ (miconazole) and CHX (cycloheximide) in AS (azole-susceptible) strains of Candicia albicans when exposed to CaCDR1/CaCDR2 inducers like FPZ (fluphenazine) and steroids [PRG (progesterone) and beta-EST (beta-oestradiol)]. By employing spot and checkerboard titre assays, we provide evidence of an in vitro-induced antagonism between tested drugs and inducers, which was accompanied with a concomitant increase in CaCDR1 and CaCDR2 transcript levels. Notably, unlike AS isolates, parental WT (wild-type) and Delta cdr2 null strains, Delta cdrl as well as Delta cdr1/Delta cdr2 nulls, when challenged with the inducers could not display antagonism. Our results validated by Northern blotting, reporter gene transcription and TRO (transcription run on) assays show that in vitro-induced antagonism between tested drugs and inducer in AS isolates was mainly due to a transient and reversible transcriptional activation of CaCDR1. Notwithstanding our earlier observation that consistent high transcript levels of CaCDR1 in clinical AR (azole-resistant) isolates were maintained due to the combination of its transcriptional activation and enhanced mRNA stability via elongated poly(A) tails, this study shows that transient and reversible transcriptional activation of CaCDR1 was the major determinant of induced antagonism in AS isolates. The distinct strategies between sustained (in AR isolates) and transiently induced resistance mechanisms (in AS isolates) adopted by Candida should become useful in improving therapeutic approaches.

"Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) is an X-linked recessive disorder of purine metabolism caused by a mutation in Xq26.2-q26.3 (OMIM 308000.0004). The presence of the diagnostic triad, i.e. signs of self-injurious behavior (SIB) and results of pedigree analysis and novel molecular biology & genetic testing, confirms the diagnosis of LNS. With a level of hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase 1 (HPRT1) enzyme activity < 2%, patients develop neurological, neurocognitive, and neuromotor symptoms along with SIB. Described here is a case of 4-year-old boy who was diagnosed with LNS. The boy displayed SIB, i.e. biting of the lips and fingers, and he had cerebral venous sinus thrombosis caused by LNS.

"Emotional processing (EP) is a complex cognitive function necessary to successfully adjust to social environments where we need to interpret and respond to cues that convey threat or reward signals. Ex-combatants have consistently shown atypical EP as well as poor social interactions. Available reintegration programs aim to facilitate the re-adaptation of ex-combatants to their communities. However, they do not incorporate actions to improve EP and to enhance cognitive-emotional regulation. The present study was aimed at evaluating the usefulness of an intervention focused on Social Cognitive Training (SCT), which was designed to equip ex-combatants enrolled in the Social Reintegration Route with EP and social cognition skills. A group of 31 ex-combatants (mean age of 37.2, 29 men) from Colombian illegal armed groups were recruited into this study. Of these, 16 were invited to take part in a SCT and the other continued with the conventional reintegration intervention. Both groups underwent 12 training sessions in a period 12-14 weeks. They were assessed with a comprehensive protocol which included Psychosocial, Behavioral, and Emotion Processing instruments. The scores on these instruments prior to and after the intervention were compared within and between groups. Both groups were matched at baseline. Ex-combatants receiving the SCT experienced significant improvements in EP and a reduction in aggressive attitudes, effects not observed in those continuing the conventional reintegration intervention. This is the first study that achieves such outcomes in such a population using SCT intervention. We discuss the implications of such results toward better social reintegration strategies.

"In this paper, we presented a novel operational amplifier (op-amp) only with solution-processed n-type amorphous indium-gallium-zinc oxide (a-IGZO) thin-film transistors (TFTs). The a-IGZO TFTs and common-source amplifier were fabricated on glass substrate through the solution process and confirmed to show stable electrical characteristics suitable for display driving circuits. Based on the experimental results, we designed an op-amp to have an overall gain of 30.5 dB, a cut-off frequency of 1.47 kHz, and a unit gain frequency of 6.65 kHz when supply voltage was +/- 15 V. Finally, by constituting the comparator, the proposed op-amp is expected to be used in power control and driving systems for display applications.

"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition with few effective treatments. Resveratrol, a polyphenolic compound, has exhibited neuroprotective effects in many neurodegenerative diseases. However, the explicit effect and mechanism of resveratrol on SCI is still unclear. Adenosine 5' monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), the downstream protein, play key roles in metabolizing of energy, resisting of resistance, and cellular protein homeostasis. In this study, we determined the effects of resveratrol on SCI and their potential relationship with SIRT1/AMPK signaling pathway, autophagy and apoptosis. To determine the effect of resveratrol on SCI recovery, a spinal cord contusion model was employed. Rats received treatment with resveratrol or DMSO immediately following contusion. We determined that Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scores were significantly higher for injured rats treated with resveratrol. Nissl and HE staining revealed that resveratrol treatment significantly reduced the loss of motor neurons and lesion size in the spinal cord of injured rats when compared to vehicle-treated animals. Spinal cord tissue was assessed by Western blot, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemical analyses 7 days after injury for changes in expression of SIRT1/AMPK signaling pathway, autophagy and apoptosis proteins. Expression of SIRT1, p-AMPK, Beclin-1, LC3-B, and Bcl-2 was elevated in resveratrol-treated animals, whereas expression of p62, Cleaved Caspase-3, Caspase-9, and Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) was inhibited. Immunofluorescence analysis of primary neurons treated with resveratrol alone or in combination with Compound C (AMPK inhibitor) or EX527 (SIRT1 inhibitor) revealed that treatment with the inhibitors blocks the increased LC3-B expression in cells and increases the portion of TUNEL-positive cells. Taken together, these results suggest that resveratrol exerts neuroprotective effects on SCI by regulating autophagy and apoptosis mediated by the SIRT1-AMPK signaling pathway. (C) 2017 IBRO.

"This paper presents a three-phase transformerless uninterruptible power supply (UPS) with sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SPWM) based division-summation (D-Sigma) digital control. A transformerless UPS controls the power flow between dc link and utility grid, as well as tracks the ac reference voltage. The proposed control law derived with D-Sigma digital approach takes into account the effects of dc-link voltage fluctuation, grid-voltage distortion and inductance variation due to different current levels. Thus, distortion of input current and filter inductor core size can be reduced significantly. However, circulating current may flow through the common ground between the input power factor corrector (PFC) and the output three-phase four-wire inverter. The derived control law based on SPWM can suppress this circulating current and regulate output voltages tightly. Experimental results measured from a three-phase transformerless UPS have confirmed the analysis and discussion of the proposed control approach.

"Forensic medical evaluation rates for child abuse victims in Texas are low relative to national rates. In exploring reasons, researchers collected quantitative and qualitative interview and focus group data from multidisciplinary child abuse response team members across the state. This paper presents results of a secondary analysis of (N = 19) health care providers' interview and focus group transcripts, looking specifically at experiences with conducting forensic evaluations thoughts, struggles, and ethical issues. The analysis was conducted from a critical realist perspective using content and discourse analysis. A theme of ambivalence was identified and explored. Three discursive themes were identified: ambivalence about the legal role, the health care role, and about unintended outcomes of evaluations. Extra-discursive elements related to the physical body, resource distribution, and funding policy were examined for their interaction with discursive patterns. ImplicatiOns of findings include addressing issues in the current approach to responding to child abuse (e.g., uniting around common definitions of abuse; refining parameters for when FME is helpful; shoring up material resources for the abuse response infrastructure) and considering modification of providers' roles and activities relative to forensic work (e.g., deploying providers for prevention activities versus reactive activities).

"We have carried out animal toxicity tests of chemicals for a chemical safety program implemented by the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry of Japan. Here, we tested 1-tert-butoxy-4-chlorobenzene in a combined repeat-dose and developmental and reproductive toxicity test. The test chemical was administered daily by gavage to 9-week-old Crl:CD (SD) rats at doses of 0, 20, 100, and 500 mg/kg/d. Males were treated for 42 d beginning 14 d before mating. Females were treated from 14 d before mating to day 4 of lactation. Decreased spontaneous locomotion, decreased respiratory rate, and incomplete eyelid opening were observed at 500 mg/kg/d (both sexes), but resolved within 30 min of administration, suggesting central nervous system depression. No notable changes were observed in body weight, food consumption, functional battery tests, or blood test. Increased liver weight with centrilobular or diffuse hepatocyte hypertrophy was observed at 100 and 500 mg/kg/d (both sexes). There were no biochemical or histopathological changes related to hepatotoxicity. Increased kidney weight with basophilic tubules, tubule dilatation, and increased hyaline droplets were observed in males dosed at 100 and 500 mg/kg/d. Immunohistochemical staining indicated alpha(2u)-globulin nephropathy, a male rat-specific toxicity. Although kidney weight was also increased in females dosed at 500 mg/kg/d, it was not considered to be an adverse effect because there were no histopathological changes. Pup weights on postnatal day 0 were decreased at 500 mg/kg/d and still decreased on postnatal day 4. Our data indicated the no-observed-adverse-effect-level for repeated-dose and reproductive/developmental toxicity for 1-tert-butoxy-4-chlorobenzene was 100 mg/kg/d.

"Young individuals better memorize initially seen faces with emotional rather than neutral expressions. Healthy older participants and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients show better memory for faces with positive expressions. The socioemotional selectivity theory postulates that this positivity effect in memory reflects a general age-related preference for positive stimuli, subserving emotion regulation. Another explanation might be that older participants use compensatory strategies, often considering happy faces as previously seen. The question about the existence of this effect in tasks not permitting such compensatory strategies is still open. Thus, we compared the performance of healthy participants and AD patients for positive, neutral, and negative faces in such tasks. Healthy older participants and AD patients showed a positivity effect in memory, but there was no difference between emotional and neutral faces in young participants. Our results suggest that the positivity effect in memory is not entirely due to the sense of familiarity for smiling faces.

"Efficient performance modeling is an extremely important task for yield analysis and design optimization of analog circuits. In this paper, a novel regression modeling method based on hierarchical shrinkage priors is proposed to construct hybrid performance models with both high accuracy and low computational cost. In particular, the user-defined model templates derived from design equations and the general-purpose orthogonal polynomials are combined together to set up a hybrid dictionary. Next, in order to avoid over-shrinking large model coefficients, a novel regression method based on hierarchical shrinkage priors and variational Bayesian inference is adopted for model fitting. A rail-to-rail operational amplifier example demonstrates that the proposed method achieves up to 40% error reduction over other state-of-the-art approaches without increasing the modeling cost.

"In grid-connected converter control, grid voltage feedforward is usually introduced to suppress the influence of grid voltage distortion on the converter's grid-side AC current. However, owing to the time-delay in control systems, the suppression effect of the grid voltage distortion is seriously affected. In this paper, the positive effects of the grid voltage feedforward control are analyzed in detail, and the time-delay caused by the low-pass filter (LPF) in the voltage filtering circuits and digital control are summarized. In order to reduce the time-delay effect on the performance of the feedforward control, a voltage feedforward control strategy with time-delay compensation is proposed, in which, a leading correction of the feedforward voltage is used. The optimal leading step used in this strategy is derived from analyzing the phase-frequency characteristics of a LPF and the implementation of digital control. By using the optimal leading step, the delay in the feedforward path can be further counteracted so that the performance of the feedforward control in terms of suppressing the influence of grid voltage distortion on the converter output current can be improved. The validity of the proposed method is verified through simulation and experiment results.

"People use at least two strategies to solve the challenge of understanding another person's mind: inferring that person's perspective by reading his or her behavior (theorization) and getting that person's perspective by experiencing his or her situation (simulation). The five experiments reported here demonstrate a strong tendency for people to underestimate the value of simulation. Predictors estimated a stranger's emotional reactions toward 50 pictures. They could either infer the stranger's perspective by reading his or her facial expressions or simulate the stranger's perspective by watching the pictures he or she viewed. Predictors were substantially more accurate when they got perspective through simulation, but overestimated the accuracy they had achieved by inferring perspective. Predictors' miscalibrated confidence stemmed from overestimating the information revealed through facial expressions and underestimating the similarity in people's reactions to a given situation. People seem to underappreciate a useful strategy for understanding the minds of others, even after they gain firsthand experience with both strategies.

"Recent environmental and economic considerations have made the focus of attention new treatment processes of the residual (tail) gas of Claus plants, based on the oxidative decomposition of H2S to Sulphur and Hydrogen, In this work, the thermal, oxidative decomposition of H2S in an homogeneous phase has been studied by developing a comprehensive chemical kinetic model for the oxidation of H2S in a low oxygen atmosphere, by varying the O-2/H2S ratio (0.2-0.35), residence time (150-300 ms), and process temperatures (900-1100 C-omicron). The kinetic model has been developed by combining existing models for the oxidation of H2S, with no tuning of the parameters or kinetic constants and validated in relation to the experimental data. The results show a very good agreement with the experimental values at higher temperatures (1100 C-omicron). At 900 C-omicron, the H2S conversion is well predicted by the model, whereas the H-2 yield and SO2 selectivity are consistently higher than the experimental values.

"When interpreting results of a functional analysis, a clinician may conclude an automatic function either because problem behavior is elevated in the alone/ignore condition relative to other conditions or because problem behavior is elevated and undifferentiated across multiple conditions. In the latter, it is difficult to determine if problem behavior is maintained by automatic reinforcement alone or is multiply maintained. The current study tested for multiply-maintained self-injurious behavior exhibited by two participants by implementing functional analysis contingencies while controlling for automatic reinforcement through sensory extinction. Results suggest that self-injury was maintained by automatic reinforcement alone for one participant and both automatic reinforcement and physical attention for another participant. These results were then used to create function-based treatments for self-injury that were successfully generalized across settings and caregivers.

"Four black fly species of the Simulium striatum species group have been recorded in Thailand. These species are morphologically highly similar in all developmental stages except for the number and arrangement of the pupal gill filaments. In this study, we used multiple characters sources, including morphology, cytology, molecular biology and ecology, to test the hypothesis of conspecificity for S. quinquestriatum (Shiraki), S. nakhonense Takaoka & Suzuki and S. chiangmaiense Takaoka & Suzuki. A molecular study based on the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) was unable to separate these taxa. In contrast, the elongation complex protein 1 (ECP1) sequences clearly differentiate S. quinquestriatum from S. chiangmaiense and S. nakhonense. However, the latter two taxa could not be differentiated based on molecular DNA sequences. Simulium chiangmaiense and S. nakhonense are also similar in the larval habitat characteristics and have undifferentiated polytene chromosome banding patterns. Morphological examination of the number and arrangement of the pupal gill filaments found a number of intermediate forms. Therefore, S. chiangmaiense and S. nakhonense are apparently the same biological species that is polymorphic for the number and arrangement of gill filaments. Thus, we synonymized S. chiangmaiense with S. nakhonense.

"Background. Systemic reactivations of herpesviruses may occur in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, even in those without prior immune deficiency. However, the clinical relevance of these events is uncertain. Methods. In this study we selected patients admitted with septic shock and treated for more than 4 days from a prospectively enrolled cohort of consecutive adults in the mixed ICUs of 2 tertiary care hospitals in the Netherlands. We excluded patients who had received antiviral treatment in the week before ICU admission and those with known immunodeficiency. We studied viremia episodes with cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), herpes simplex virus types 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2), and varicella zoster virus (VZV) by weekly polymerase chain reaction in plasma. Results. Among 329 patients, we observed 399 viremia episodes in 223 (68%) patients. Viremia with CMV, EBV, HHV-6, HSV1, HSV-2, and VZV was detected in 60 (18%), 157 (48%), 80 (24%), 87 (26%), 13 (4%), and 2 (0.6%) patients, respectively; 112 (34%) patients had multiple concurrent viremia events. Crude mortality in the ICU was 36% in this latter group compared to 19% in remaining patients (P < .01). After adjustment for potential confounders, time-dependent bias, and competing risks, only concurrent CMV and EBV reactivations remained independently associated with increased mortality (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio, 3.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.41-7.13). Conclusions. Herpesvirus reactivations were documented in 68% of septic shock patients without prior immunodeficiency and frequently occurred simultaneously. Concurrent reactivations could be independently associated with mortality.

"Background and ObjectivesAmelogenin proteins are the major constituent of developing extracellular enamel matrix and are believed to have an exclusively epithelial origin. Recent studies have suggested that amelogenins might induce the differentiation and maturation of various cells, including cementoblast lineage cells. However, the residues comprising the active site of amelogenin remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to identify the active site region of amelogenin by studying the effects of amelogenin fragments on the osteogenic differentiation of cementoblasts. Material and MethodsAmelogenin fragments lacking the C-terminus (rh163) and N-terminus (rh128) and a fragment consisting of the C-terminal region of rh174 (C11 peptide) were synthesized and purified. Human cementoblast lineage cells were cultured in osteogenic differentiation medium and treated with 0, 10, 100 or 1000 ng/mL of rh163, rh128 or C11 peptide. The mRNA levels of bone markers were examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. Alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium deposition were also determined. Mineralization was evaluated by alizarin red staining. ResultsThe osteogenic differentiation of human cementoblast lineage cells was significantly enhanced by treatment with rh128 or C11 peptide, whereas rh163 had no significant effect as compared with untreated controls. ConclusionsThe C-terminus of amelogenin promotes the osteogenic differentiation of human cementoblast lineage cells, indicating the possible utility of C11 peptide in periodontal tissue regeneration.

"Chlamydia trachomatis genital infection is the most common sexually transmitted bacterial disease, causing a significant burden to females due to reproductive dysfunction. Intensive screening and antibiotic treatment are unable to completely prevent female reproductive dysfunction, thus, efforts have become focused on developing a vaccine. A major impediment is identifying a safe and effective adjuvant which induces cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) cells with attributes capable of halting genital infection and inflammation. Previously, we described a natural nanocapsule called the vault which was engineered to contain major outer membrane protein (MOMP) and was an effective vaccine which significantly reduced early infection and favored development of a cellular immune response in a mouse model. In the current study, we used another chlamydial antigen, a polymorphic membrane protein G-1 (PmpG) peptide, to track antigen-specific cells and evaluate, in depth, the vault vaccine for its protective capacity in the absence of an added adjuvant. We found PmpG-vault immunized mice significantly reduced the genital bacterial burden and histopathologic parameters of inflammation following a C. muridarum challenge. Immunization boosted antigen-specific CD4 cells with a multiple cytokine secretion pattern and reduced the number of inflammatory cells in the genital tract making the vault vaccine platform safe and effective for chlamydial genital infection. We conclude that vaccination with a Chlamydia-vault vaccine boosts antigen-specific immunities that are effective at eradicating infection and preventing reproductive tract inflammation.

"In the present study, we have investigated the effect of (i) ET-I (endothelin-1) and its precursor, big ET-1, on MMP (matrix metal loproteinase)-2 and MMP-9 synthesis and activity in osteosarcoma tissue, and (ii) ET-I receptor antagonists on cell invasion. Using Western blotting, zymography, RT-PCR (reverse transcription-PCR), immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and Northern blotting, we have shown that ET-I and ET-I receptors (ETA and ETB) were expressed in these cells. Additionally, we have demonstrated that ET-I markedly induced the synthesis and activity of MMP-2, which was significantly increased when compared with MMP-9. Furthermore, inhibition of NF-kappa B (nuclear factor kappa B) activation blocked MMP-2 production and activity, indicating the involvement of NF-kappa B, a ubiquitous transcription factor playing a central role in the differentiation, proliferation and malignant transformation. Since ET-I acts as an autocrine mediator through gelatinase induction and because inhibition of ETA receptor is beneficial for reducing both basal and ET-I-induced osteosarcoma cell invasion, targeting this receptor could be an attractive therapeutic alternative for the successful treatment of osteosarcoma.

"In this study, a specific and sensitive method for simultaneous detection of human astrovirus, human rotavirus, norovirus, sapovirus and enteric adenovirus associated with acute enteritis was developed, based on the specific dual priming oligonucleotide (DPO) system and the sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. The DPO system-based multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) combined with HPLC assay was more sensitive than agarose gel electrophoresis analysis and real-time SYBR Green PCR assay, and showed a specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 96%-100%. The high sensitivity and specificity of the assay indicates its great potential to be a useful tool for the accurate diagnosis of enteric virus infections. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"Objective: Cognitive challenges are prominent features of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia, impairing occupational, social, and economic functioning. These challenges are predictive of social and work outcomes. Cognitive remediation has been shown to be effective in improving both cognitive and social functions. However, cognitive remediation does not produce improvement in all participants. We investigated demographic, neurocognitive, and psychopathological predictors associated with improvement following cognitive remediation interventions in service recipients with severe mental illnesses. Method: One hundred thirty-seven adult participants with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text rev.) were enrolled in 12-week cognitive remediation programs. Assessments of demographic and illness variables, together with baseline and end point assessment of psychopathology (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS]), neurocognition (Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia [MATRICS] Consensus Cognitive Battery [MCBB]), and social functions (Personal and Social Performance Scale [PSP]) were conducted. Change in cognitive domains was calculated using the reliable change index. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess predictors of cognitive improvement after the intervention. Results: Sixty-two percent of participants improved on at least 1 of the MCCB domains. Higher baseline speed of processing, attention or vigilance, and working memory predicted a positive response to cognitive remediation. Younger age, higher education level, shorter length of stay, and lower PANSS Negative and Disorganized factors were additional predictors. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Our results indicate the clinical usefulness of cognitive remediation and identified a pattern of clinical and cognitive predictors of good response to the intervention. Identification of these predictive factors by clinicians may enhance the outcome and aid in the development of individualized rehabilitative cognitive remediation treatment plans.

"A simultaneous bidirectional transceiver over a single wire has been developed in a 65 nm CMOS technology for a command and control bus. The echo signals of the simultaneous bidirectional link are cancelled by controlling the decision level of receiver comparators without power-hungry operational amplifier (op-amp) based circuits. With the clock information embedded in the rising edges of the signals sent from the source side to the sink side, the data is recovered by an open-loop digital circuit with 20 times blind oversampling. The data rate of the simultaneous bidirectional transceiver in each direction is 75 Mbps and therefore the overall signaling bandwidth is 150 Mbps. The measured energy efficiency of the transceiver is 56.7 pJ/b and the bit-error-rate (BER) is less than 10(-12) with 2(7)-1 pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) pattern for both signaling directions.

"Sugarcane grassy shoot (SCGS) disease is associated with the presence of 16SrXI group phytoplasmas that are transmitted by leafhoppers; limited studies have been performed in India toward its natural transmission. To determine the insect vectors that transmit the disease in nature, leafhopper species from SCGS-infected fields at Shahjahanpur, Central Uttar Pradesh, India, were collected and analyzed for phytoplasma presence using nested polymerase chain reaction with phytoplasma-specific primers. An similar to 1.2-kb amplified DNA fragment was detected in nested PCR from the three major leafhopper species, viz. Maiestas portica (Melichar), Exitianus indicus (Ross) and Cofana unimaculata (Signoret), and the symptomatic sugarcane leaves of variety CoS 07250. BLASTn analysis of similar to 1.2-kb 16S rDNA partial sequences obtained from symptomatic sugarcane plants and these leafhoppers revealed 99-100 % sequence identities among themselves and 99 % identity with other reported strains of 'Candidatus Phytoplasma oryzae' (16SrXI group). Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA sequences of SCGS, M. portica, C. unimaculata and E. indicus phytoplasma strains also indicated the closest phylogenetic relationship with those of 'Ca. P. oryzae' group. Transmission tests and population sampling study further confirmed that M. portica and C. unimaculata were vectors of the SCGS phytoplasma from diseased to healthy sugarcane plants. The identification of new vectors of SCGS phytoplasma suggested that these leafhopper species may be responsible for secondary spread of SCGS phytoplasma.

"The paper presents a high-voltage integrated-circuit driver capable of producing analog voltages up to 300 V, using Dalsa's 0.8-mu m HV CMOS/DMOS process, suitable for MEMS and medical systems. The IC driver includes a HV operational amplifier (op-amp) with a class-B output stage, and HV analog switches with improved off-isolation performance. In contrast to previous frequency compensation schemes, where only one dominant pole occurs below the unity-gain bandwidth, the HV op-amp employs a novel frequency compensation topology with three poles and two zeros located within the unity-gain bandwidth, and is capable of driving large capacitive loads from 100 pF to 10 nF. Theoretical analysis of off-isolation of the HV analog switches is also reported and confirms the improvement in off-isolation performance.

"Allatostatins are important regulatory neuropeptides which are widely distributed in invertebrates and execute their functions through either neural or Immoral routes. However, the regulatory mechanism of the gene expression is unclear. In this paper, we report a naturally occurring amisense transcript, named as asMacro-AST A, of the crustacean FGLamide allatostatin gene (Macro-AST A) from the prawn, Macrobrachium rosenbergii. The asMacro-ASTA contains an 843-bp sequence fully complementary to the 3'end of the Macro-ASTA. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a natural antisense transcript in crustacean and the first endogenous antisense transcript of all identified allatostatin genes. Northern blotting analysis demonstrated that the gene was expressed in the thoracic ganglia where the sense gene was also expressed. Furthermore, we have detected a RNA-RNA duplex between the sense-antisense complementary region by using RNasc protection analysis and RT-PCR. These results suggest that the antisense gene may play a role in the regulation of Macro-AST A gene expression. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

"Chronic social behavior problems after pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) significantly contribute to poor quality of life for survivors. Using a well-characterized mouse model of early childhood TBI, we have previously demonstrated that young brain-injured mice develop social deficits by adulthood. As biological sex may influence both normal and aberrant social development, we here evaluated potential sex differences in post-TBI psychosocial deficits by comparing the behavior of male and female mice at adulthood (8 weeks post-injury). Secondly, we hypothesized that pediatric TBI would influence neuronal morphology identified by Golgi-Cox staining in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, regions involved in social cognition and behavior, before the onset of social problems (3 weeks post-injury). Morphological analysis of pyramidal neurons in the ipsilateral prefrontal cortex and granule cells of the hippocampal dentate gyrus revealed a reduction in dendritic complexity after pediatric TBI. This was most apparent in TBI males, whereas neurons from females were less affected. At adulthood, consistent with previous studies, TBI males showed deficits in sociability and social recognition. TBI females also showed a reduction in sociability, but intact social recognition and increased sociosexual avoidance. Together, these findings indicate that sex is a determinant of regional neuroplasticity and social outcomes after pediatric TBI. Reduced neuronal complexity in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, several weeks after injury in male mice, appears to precede the subsequent emergence of social deficits. Sex-specific alterations in the social brain network are thus implicated as an underlying mechanism of social dysfunction after pediatric TBI. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"The X chromosome has played a critical role in the development of sexually selected characteristics for over 300 million years, and during that time it has accumulated a disproportionate number of genes concerned with mental functions. There are relatively specific effects of X-linked genes on social cognition, language, emotional regulation, visuospatial, and numerical skills. Many human X-linked genes outside the X-Y pairing pseudoautosomal regions escape X-inactivation. Dosage differences in the expression of such genes (which constitute at least 15% of the total) are likely to play an important role in male-female neural differentiation, and in cognitive deficits and behavioral characteristics, particularly in the realm of social communication, that are associated with sex chromosome aneuploidies.

"This article uses an intersectionality lens to explore how experiences of race, gender, sexuality, class and their intersections are associated with depression and unmet need for mental healthcare in a population of 704 women and transgender/gender liminal people from Ontario, Canada. A survey collecting demographic information, information about mental health and use of mental healthcare services, and data for the Everyday Discrimination Scale and the PHQ-9 Questionnaire for Depression was completed by 704 people via Internet or pen-and-paper between June 2011 and June 2012. Bivariate and regression analyses were conducted to assess group differences in depression and discrimination experiences, and predictors of depression and unmet need for mental healthcare services. Analyses revealed that race, gender, class and sexuality all corresponded to significant differences in exposure to discrimination, experiences of depression and unmet needs for mental healthcare. Use of interaction terms to model intersecting identities and exclusion contributed to explained variance in both outcome variables. Everyday discrimination was the strongest predictor of both depression and unmet need for mental healthcare. The results suggest lower income and intersections of race with other marginalised identities are associated with more depression and unmet need for mental healthcare; however, discrimination is the factor that contributes the most to those vulnerabilities. Future research can build on intersectionality theory by foregrounding the role of structural inequities and discrimination in promoting poor mental health and barriers to healthcare.

"Child wellbeing is identified as one of the three primary goals for child welfare outcomes, thus strong wellbeing assessment tools are crucial to the monitoring of child welfare success. Data from wellbeing measures can serve to identify child needs, inform case planning, monitor change over time, and evaluate intervention impact at the individual, local, state, and national levels. This paper examines the goals, strengths, and challenges of four wellbeing measures currently used with child welfare populations, namely: the Child and Adolescent Functional Assessment Scale (CAFAS), the Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths Assessment Tool (CANS), the Child Behavior Checklist and related tools from the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (CBCL/ASEBA), and the Treatment Outcomes Package (TOP). For each measure, we describe the content, practical attributes, clinical applications, and evidence of reliability and validity. We explore implementation considerations and provide recommendations for system changes to ensure the optimal use of each instrument. Agencies are encouraged to carefully consider their needs, goals, capacities, and implementation infrastructure to inform selection of tools that will aid them in successfully supporting and monitoring child wellbeing over time.

"The recommendation system is a useful tool that can be employed to identify potential relationships between items and users in electronic commerce systems. Consequently, it can remarkably improve the efficiency of a business. The topic of how to enhance the accuracy of a recommendation has attracted much attention by researchers over the past decade. As such, many methods to accomplish this task have been introduced. However, more complex calculations are normally necessary to achieve a higher accuracy, which is not suitable for a real-time system. Hence, in this paper, we propose a weight-based item recommendation approach to provide a balanced formula between the recommended accuracy and the computational complexity. The proposed methods employ a newly defined distance to describe the relationship between the users and the items, after which the recommendations and predictive algorithms are developed. A data analysis based on the MovieLens datasets indicates that the methods applied can obtain suitable prediction accuracy and maintain a relatively low computational complexity.

"The research ""Behavior Change and Energy Use"" (US Department of Energy and Climate Change, 2011) [1] shows that with better information in the monthly electricity bill, the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) can encourage people to reduce their energy usage. That is why smart meters - the emerging technology to help people to know their monthly energy consumption, are gradually replacing mechanical power meters. In this paper, we investigate a special energy monitoring process named Non-Intrusive Appliance Load Monitoring (NIALM), which is potentially the best method to give consumers pertinent information with respect to power consumption. However, real-time feedback feature in a low cost NIALM system is still a big challenge in such technology because of the complication in NIALM's algorithms. System on Chip (SoC) technology can solve this challenge. Besides including high-speed interconnection and multi-processors, integrating Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) into SoCs may be the most important evolution, which provides developers a powerful tool to develop a low cost but high performance system. Therefore, in this paper we proposed a development of a real-time NIALM system based on the SoC with FPGA acceleration. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"Background: Anterior encephalocele (AE) is a rare congenital anomaly of the central nervous system which is thought to be associated with genetic defects in folate metabolism. Methods: This case-control study investigated the interactions of methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1 (MTHFD1)-1958G>A (rs2236225) and the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) - 677C>T (rs1801133) and 1298A>C (rs1801131) polymorphisms with the risk of AE in the Northeast Indian population. A total of 40 AE cases and 80 controls were investigated using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. Results: MTHFR 1298CC was significantly associated with AE risk (odds ratio [OR] 4.21; p = 0.01). The MTHFR haplotypes 677C-1298C/677T-1298A (OR, 2.50) and 677T-1298C (OR, 2.86) conferred risk in a progressive manner ((2) = 9.82; pA was not associated with disease susceptibility. Children with the rs2236225 GA and the rs1801131 CC genotypes were at an increased risk as compared to the reference genotype of rs2236225 GG and rs1801131 AA (OR, 14.4; p = 0.02). Children with the rs2236225 GG and rs1801133 CT genotypes were also at an elevated risk (OR, 4.76; p = 0.01). The MTHFD1 polymorphism together with the MTHFR haplotypes elevated risk in a progressive manner (chi(2) = 6.29; p = 0.01). Conclusion: The data support our hypothesis of gene-gene interaction between MTHFD1 and MTHFR and the risk of AE. Together with the MTHFR haplotypes, MTHFD1 elevates risk in a progressive manner. The minor allelic frequencies of the MTHFD1 1958G>A and MTHFR 1298A>C in our populations were similar to those reported from Southeast Asian population, suggesting a possible explanation for the prevalence of this malformation in these regions.

"Women with breast cancer frequently report distressing symptoms during and after treatment that can significantly erode quality of life (QOL). Symptom burden among women with breast cancer is of complex etiology and is likely influenced by disease, treatment, and environmental factors as well as individual genetic differences. The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationships between genetic polymorphisms within Neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor 1 (NTRK1), Neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor 2 (NTRK2), and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and patient symptom burden of QOL, pain, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance before, during, and after treatment for breast cancer in a subset of participants (N = 51) in a randomized clinical trial of a novel symptom-management modality for women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Patients were recruited at the time of initial breast cancer diagnosis and completed all survey measures at the time of recruitment, after the initiation of treatment (surgery and/or chemotherapy), and then following treatment conclusion. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed significant associations between NTRK2 and COMT single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype and symptom burden. Two COMT variants were associated with the specific symptoms of anxiety and QOL measures prior to the initiation of chemotherapy as well as pain interference and severity during and after treatment. Genotype at the NTRK2 SNP rs1212171 was associated with both sleep disturbance and fatigue. These findings, while exploratory, indicate that the genotypes of NTRK2 and COMT may contribute to relative risk for symptom burden during and shortly after the period of chemotherapy in women with early stage breast cancer.

"Cancer/testis (CT) antigens are promising targets for immunotherapy due to their restricted expression in the germ cells of the testis in healthy tissue and high immunogenicity. The aim of the present study was to determine whether transmembrane protein 31 (TMEM31) is a CT antigen and to investigate the pattern of TMEM31 expression during the progression of melanoma. The pattern of expression of human TMEM31 mRNA in multiple human tissues was determined through reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis. TMEM31 protein expression was analyzed in the human testis, in addition to 128 primary melanoma and 64 metastatic melanoma samples through immunohistochemistry analysis. TMEM31 was identified to be predominantly expressed in the testis and weakly expressed in the placenta. In addition, TMEM31 protein expression was detected in 120/190 (63.16%) melanoma samples (primary and metastatic). The intensity of TMEM31 staining in metastatic and primary melanomas was determined through semiquantitative integrated optical density (IOD) analysis, and identified to be significantly increased in metastatic melanoma compared with primary melanoma (0.24 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.09 +/- 0.01 IOD/area; P<0.001). The expression of TMEM31 protein was significantly increased in metastatic compared with primary melanoma samples (76.56 vs. 56.35%; P=0.017). The results of the present study suggest that TMEM31 is a novel CT antigen that serves an essential role in melanoma metastasis, in addition to being a potential immunotherapeutic target for the treatment of patients with melanoma.

"Through the comprehensive analysis of the genomic DNA sequence of human chromosome 22, we identified a novel gene of 702 kb encoding a big protein of 2481 amino acid residues, and named it as TPRBK (TPR containing big gene cloned at Keio). A novel protein TPRBK possesses 25 units of the TPR motif, which has been known to associate with a diverse range of biological functions. Orthologous genes of human TPRBK were found widely in animal species, from insecta to mammal, but not found in plants, fungi and nematoda. Northern blotting and RT-PCR analyses revealed that TPRBK gene is expressed ubiquitously in the human and mouse fetal tissues and various cell lines of human, monkey and mouse. lmmunofluorescent staining of the synchronized monkey COS-7 cells with several relevant antibodies indicated that TPRBK changes its subcellular localization during the cell cycle: at interphase TPRBK locates on the centrosomes, during mitosis it translocates from spindle poles to mitotic spindles then to spindle midzone, and through a period of cytokinesis it stays on the midbody. Co-immunoprecipitation assay and immunofluorescent staining with adequate antibodies revealed that TPRBK binds to Aurora B. and those proteins together translocate throughout mitosis and cytokinesis. Treatments of cells with two drugs (Blebbistatin and Y-27632), that are known to inhibit the contractility of actin-myosin, disturbed the proper intracellular localization of TPRBK. Moreover, the knockdown of TPRBK expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) suppressed the bundling of spindle midzone microtubules and disrupted the midbody formation, arresting the cells at G(2) + M phase. These observations indicated that a novel big protein TPRBK is essential for the formation and integrity of the midbody, hence we postulated that TPRBK plays a critical role in the progress of mitosis and cytokinesis during mammalian cell cycle.

"BACKGROUND: Polymorphisms in genes encoding tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and its receptor TNF-R1 have been shown to affect one person's susceptibility to develop certain neoplastic diseases. The aim of the present association study was to investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TNF-alpha (-308G>A) and TNF-R1 (36A>G) genes modulate the susceptibility for keratocystic odontogenic tumors (KCOTs) development in Serbian patients. METHODS: Genotyping was performed in 60 KCOT patients and 125 healthy individuals, using polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. RESULTS: A significant difference in genotype and allele frequencies was found between patients and controls for both SNPs (P < 0.05). Carriers of the TNF-alpha A variant had an eightfold increase of KCOT risk (OR = 8.12, 95% CI = 3.98-16.56, P < 0.0001), while carriers of the TNF-R1 G variant had approximately a fourfold increase of KCOT risk (OR= 3.65, CI: 1.60-8.40, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the two polymorphisms are strong risk factors for KCOT development in Serbian population.

"Because of the limitations of standard culture techniques, the development of new recombinant protein expression systems with biotechnological potential is a key challenge. Ideally, such systems should be able to effectively and accurately synthesize a protein of interest with intrinsic metabolic capacity. Here, we describe such a system that was designed based on a plasmid vector containing promoter elements derived from the metallothionein MTIla promoter, as well as processing and purification elements. This promoter can be induced by heavy metals in a culture medium to induce the synthesis of human prostate-specific antigen (hPSA), which has been modified to insert elements for purification, proteolysis, and secretion. We optimized hPSA production in this system by comparing the effects and contributions of ZnCl2, CdCl2, and CuSO4 in HEK293FT, HeLa, BHK-21, and CHO-K1 cells. We also compared the effectiveness of three different transfection agents: multi-walled carbon nanotubes, Lipofectamine 2000, and X-tremeGENE HP Reagent. hPSA production was confirmed via the detection of enhanced green fluorescent protein fluorescence, and cell viability was determined. The expression of hPSA was compared with that of the native protein produced by LNCaP cells, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. X-tremeGENE reagent, the BHK-21 cell line, and CuSO4 showed the highest hPSA production rates. Furthermore, BHK-21 cells were more resistant to the oxidative stress caused by 100 mu M CuSO4. These results suggest that the proposed optimized inducible expression system can effectively produce recombinant proteins with desired characteristics for a wide range of applications in molecular biology.

"A switchable operational amplifier (opamp) is examined in this brief. It is based on a current-mirror opamp with switchable transconductance values. Contrary to switched opamp (SO) and partial SO, it can be used to realize both half-delay and full-delay switched-capacitor integrators. The added circuit design complexity is shown to be minimal. Optimal switching is developed in this brief. It is also shown in this brief that the absolute average power consumption can be less as compared with an SO design. The experimental results of a delta-sigma modulator prototype (designed in 1-V 65-nm CMOS), employing the designated switchable-opamp technique, show power reduction without any degradation in SNDR (58.5 dB) or SFDR (67 dB).

"Neuroimaging techniques have greatly enhanced the understanding of neurodiversity (human brain variation across individuals) in both health and disease. The ultimate goal of using brain imaging biomarkers is to perform individualized predictions. Here we proposed a generalized framework that can predict explicit values of the targeted measures by taking advantage of joint information from multiple modalities. This framework also enables whole brain voxel-wise searching by combining multivariate techniques such as ReliefF, clustering, correlation-based feature selection and multiple regression models, which is more flexible and can achieve better prediction performance than alternative atlas-based methods. For 50 healthy controls and 47 schizophrenia patients, three kinds of features derived from resting-state fMRI (fALFF), sMRI (gray matter) and DTI (fractional anisotropy) were extracted and fed into a regression model, achieving high prediction for both cognitive scores (MCCB composite r = 0.7033, MCCB social cognition r = 0.7084) and symptomatic scores (positive and negative syndrome scale [PANSS] positive r = 0.7785, PANSS negative r = 0.7804). Moreover, the brain areas likely responsible for cognitive deficits of schizophrenia, including middle temporal gyrus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, striatum, cuneus and cerebellum, were located with different weights, as well as regions predicting PANSS symptoms, including thalamus, striatum and inferior parietal lobule, pinpointing the potential neuromarkers. Finally, compared to a single modality, multimodal combination achieves higher prediction accuracy and enables individualized prediction on multiple clinical measures. There is more work to be done, but the current results highlight the potential utility of multimodal brain imaging biomarkers to eventually inform clinical decision-making. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"[Objective] To investigate the effect of cordyceps sinensis (CS) on expression of uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2) and so to elucidate the role of UCP2 in development of nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD). [Methods] Rats were administrated with high-fat diet to produce NAFLD animal model and intervened by cordyceps sinensis. Triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC) in liver were measured by biochemistry, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by luciferin-luciferinase, and UCP2 expression by Northern blotting and immunohistochemistry. Liver histopathology was evaluated. [Results] High-fat diet fed rats developed obesity and showed a gradual increase in body weight, liver index, and a decrease in ATP level. More advanced liver disease was found histopathologically for longer high-fat diet. Up-regulation of liver UCP2 by high-fat diet stopped after week 12. However codyceps sinensis induced UCP2 up-regulation continuously, and kept liver ATP a relatively high level. [Conclusion] NAFLD rat models were produced successfully. Liver UCP2 up-regulation in NAFLD rats may be a definite beneficial adaptation to lipid exposure. Cordyceps sinensis may serve a protective role to prevent NAFLD from progression. One of the possible mechanisms involves in modulating UCP2 expression and thereby, regulating fat metabolism, energy homeostasis.

"The complement system is a major pillar of the humoral innate immune system. As a first line of defense against pathogens, it mediates early inflammatory response and links different branches of humoral and cellular immunity. Disorders affecting the exocrine pancreas, such as acute pancreatitis, potentially lead to a life-threatening systemic inflammatory response with aberrant activation of complement and coagulation cascades. Pancreatic proteases can activate key effectors of the complement system, which in turn drive local and systemic inflammation. Beyond that, the extent of pancreas-complement interaction covers complex pro-and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, which to this day remain to be fully elucidated. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the pathophysiological role of complement in diseases of the exocrine pancreas, based on existing experimental and clinical data. Participation of complement in acute and chronic pancreatitis is addressed, as well as its role in tumor immunology. Therapeutic strategies targeting complement in these diseases have long been proposed but have not yet arrived in the clinical setting.

"Purpose of reviewThis review gives an overview of the systems-immunology single-cell proteomic and transcriptomic approaches that can be applied to study primary immunodeficiency. It also introduces recent advances in multiparameter tissue imaging, which allows extensive immune phenotyping in disease-affected tissue.Recent findingsMass cytometry is a variation of flow cytometry that uses rare earth metal isotopes instead of fluorophores as tags bound to antibodies, allowing simultaneous measurement of over 40 parameters per single-cell. Mass cytomety enables comprehensive single-cell immunophenotyping and functional assessments, capturing the complexity of the immune system, and the molecularly heterogeneous consequences of primary immunodeficiency defects. Protein epitopes and transcripts can be simultaneously detected allowing immunophenotype and gene expression evaluation in mixed cell populations. Multiplexed epitope imaging has the potential to provide extensive phenotypic characterization at the subcellular level, in the context of 3D tissue microenvironment.SummaryMass cytometry and multiplexed epitope imaging can complement genetic methods in diagnosis and study of the pathogenesis of primary immunodeficiencies. The ability to understand the effect of a specific defect across multiple immune cell types and pathways, and in affected tissues, may provide new insight into tissue-specific disease pathogenesis and evaluate effects of therapeutic interventions.

"Background: Suicide rates are higher in veterans compared to the general population, perhaps due to trauma exposure. Previous literature highlights depressive symptoms and anger as contributors to suicide risk. PTSD symptoms may indirectly affect suicide risk by increasing the severity of such cognitive-emotional factors. Method: A sample of community dwelling veterans (N=545) completed online surveys, including the PTSD Checklist-Military Version, Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised, Multidimensional Health ProfilePsychosocial Functioning, and Differential Emotions Scale -Iv. Bivariate and serial mediation analyses were conducted to test for direct and indirect effects of PTSD symptoms on suicide risk. Results: In bivariate analyses, PTSD symptoms, depression, anger, and internal hostility were positively related to suicide risk. In serial mediation analyses, there was a significant total effect of PTSD symptoms on suicide risk in both models. PTSD symptoms were also indirectly related to suicidal behavior via depression and internal hostility, and via internal hostility alone. Anger was not a significant mediator. Limitation: Our cross-sectional sample was predominantly White and male; prospective studies with diverse veterans are needed. Discussion: Our findings may have implications for veteran suicide prevention. The effects of PTSD and depression on anger, particularly internal hostility, are related to suicide risk, suggesting a potential mechanism of action for the PTSD-suicide linkage. A multi-faceted therapeutic approach, targeting depression and internal hostility, via cognitive-behavioral techniques such as behavioral activation and cognitive restructuring, may reduce suicide risk in veterans who have experienced trauma.

"Microtremor survey is a kind of passive-source methods which uses ambient ground tremors for geological investigation. Compared with traditional geophysical methods, it is more flexible, cost-efficient, and environmentally friendly. Most currently used geophones are expensive and bulky, and therefore inconvenient to large-scale deployment. In this study, a no-cable low-cost geophone was optimized to suit for large-scale microtremor survey. The method of optimization is based on the following four points: First, it selects a sensor through the analysis of the self-noise of to meet the needs of microtremor survey. Second, it chooses the right operational amplifier and AD conversion module. Third, it integrates design of the entire system without using external module. And fourth, it makes a low-cost design of the geophone system, including selection of low-cost hardware components and reducing the amount of software code. Finally, the optimized geophone was used in three areas with different geological conditions in order to verify the rationality of the improvement and the possibilities for large-scale microtremor survey. The purpose of optimization has been achieved in this research. The no-cable geophone wrights only 600 g, and the maximum average power cost does not exceed 0. 1 mW. The entire system costs less than 2000 RMB. The most important thing is the optimized geophone can record the microtremor signal from O. 5 to 20 Hz effectively. Experiments show that in different geological conditions the geophone can be setup quickly and work smoothly and reliably. The results of microtremor survey experiments are consistent with the existing geological data. Because the new geophone is much cheaper than the existing microtremor survey equipment, it is possible to use it in low-cost large-scale survey. The optimized geophone has a very small volume and light weight, and can be rapidly emplacedinto a variety of detector arrays. After the emplacement of large number of geophones, it can easily and quickly conduct survey to two-dimensional or three-dimensional velocity structure of the area. Such microtremor survey with environment-friendly and low-cost advantages has broad application prospects.

"Adult victims of child physical abuse (CPA) are more likely to perpetrate intimate partner violence (IPV) than are nonvictims. However, not all CPA victims go on to become violent toward their partners, suggesting that other factors moderate risk for IPV perpetration. Drawing on the background-situational model (Riggs & O'Leary, 1989, 1996), this study examines the independent and interactive effects of CPA history and negative affect arising during conflict with an intimate partner in predicting physical IPV perpetration. Fifty-three heterosexual dating couples completed questionnaires assessing CPA history and perpetration of physical IPV. Couples discussed the largest source of conflict in their relationship for 10 min. Videos of these discussions were coded for negative affect. Using an actor partner interdependence model approach to account for the dyadic interdependence of the data, findings revealed that at average levels of negative affect, CPA severity predicted greater IPV perpetration for both men and women. However, at average levels of CPA, negative affect during conflict was positively predictive of IPV perpetration for men only. Findings further revealed an interaction such that for men, the positive association between CPA severity and IPV perpetration became stronger as their negative affect during conflict increased.

"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, similar to 22 nucleotide length RNAs that perform gene regulation. Recently, miRNA has been shown to be linked with the onset of cancer and other diseases based on miRNA expression levels. It is important, therefore, to understand miRNA function as it pertains to disease onset; however, in order to fully understand miRNA's role in a disease, it is necessary to detect the expression levels of these small molecules. The most widely used miRNA detection method is Northern blotting, which is considered as the standard of miRNA detection methods. This method, however, is time-consuming and has low sensitivity. This has led to an increase in the amount of detection methods available. These detection methods are either solid phase, occurring on a solid support, or solution phase, occurring in solution. While the solid-phase methods are adaptable to high-throughput screening and possess higher sensitivity than Northern blotting, they lack the ability for in vivo use and are often time-consuming. The solution-phase methods are advantageous in that they can be performed in vivo, are very sensitive, and are rapid; however, they cannot be applied in high-throughput settings. Although there are multiple detection methods available, including microarray technology, luminescence-based assays, electrochemical assays, etc., there is still much work to be done regarding miRNA detection. The current gaps of miRNA detection include the ability to perform multiplex, sensitive detection of miRNA with single-nucleotide specificity along with the standardization of these new methods. Current miRNA detection methods, gaps in these methods, miRNA therapeutic options, and the future outlook of miRNA detection are presented here.

"Laboratory testing of tidal turbine models is an essential tool to investigate hydrodynamic interactions between turbines and the flow. Such tests can be used to calibrate numerical models and to estimate rotor loading and wake development to inform the design of full scale machines and array layout. The details of the design and manufacturing techniques used to develop a highly instrumented turbine model are presented. The model has a 1.2 m diameter, three bladed horizontal axis rotor and is bottom mounted. Particular attention is given to the instrumentation which can measure streamwise root bending moment for each blade and torque and thrust for the overall rotor. The model is mainly designed to investigate blade and shaft loads due to both turbulence and waves. Initial results from tests in a 2 m deep by 4 m wide flume are also presented.

"Air pollution represented by haze in China has attracted great global attention in recent years. China has recently introduced a series of action plans to improve air quality and prevent air pollution. Remediation on small coal-fired boilers and the development of heat and power cogeneration (HPC) and centralized heat supply (CHS) are important measures for preventing air pollution. This paper introduces the above mentioned policies, An industrial park in Guangdong Province, China, is taken as an example to analyze the contributions of HPC-based industrial CHS to energy saving and environmental protection. The benefits to the heat supplier and user are also analyzed. Furthermore, this paper presents the difficulties and challenges in developing industrial CHS, including mismatching in the early phase, price dispute, measure dispute, and negative inter-effects. The reasons for these problems are analyzed and possible solutions are provided. (C) 2016 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.

"P>Oryza meyeriana Baill was found immune to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). However, the genes responsible for the strong resistance are unknown. In this study, suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) was utilized to identify genes differentially expressed in O. meyeriana after Xoo infection. Oryza meyeriana plants inoculated with high pathogenicity races were used as 'tester' and non-inoculated plants as 'driver'. Analysis of the SSH library revealed genes responsible for cell wall lignifications, which may function to block pathogen invasion. Also identified are genes involved in secondary metabolism systems to eliminate damage caused by chemicals such as peroxides in cells. One of the response genes, ME281 encoding a protein with leucine-rich repeats which has high similarity with those of other reported disease resistance genes, was further analysed by RT-PCR and Northern blotting, which showed its expression peaked at 48-72 h after Xoo infection, suggesting that it may function at the later stage of the plant's responses. This study would help demonstrate the molecular mechanism of O. meyeriana's strong resistance to Xoo and find new disease resistance candidate genes.

"This article compares multiple types of child maltreatment among Puerto Rican youth. We seek to expand the limited knowledge of the effects of multiple types of maltreatment on depressive symptoms in a specific Latino population as emerging studies indicate that children who are exposed to one type of maltreatment are often exposed to other types. This study examines the predictive strength of different and multiple types of lifetime child maltreatment (i.e., physical, sexual, and emotional abuse; and neglect), and the effect of youth support from parents, youth coping, youth self-esteem, and place of residence on depressive symptoms among Puerto Rican youth. Secondary data analyses were performed using three annual waves (2000-2004) of data from the Boricua Youth Study. The analytic sample consists of 1041 10-13 year old Puerto Rican youth living in New York and Puerto Rico. Results indicate that: (1) youth who experienced 'sexual abuse only', 'multiple maltreatment' (2 or more types of maltreatment), 'physical abuse only' have a significant increase in depressive symptoms (75.1%, 61.6%, and 40.5% respectively) compared to those without maltreatment; and (2) place of residence, exposure to violence, and mental disorders were significant risk factors. When developing psychosocial interventions, professionals should particularly focus on youth who report past lifetime experience with child maltreatment. Particular attention should be given to children living in the Bronx, New York and similar urban low-income areas who report past lifetime experience with multiple types of child maltreatment and who present symptoms or a diagnosis of co-occurring mental health problems.

"Recent theoretical models suggest that repetitive negative thinking might be a key mechanism explaining the negative effects of maternal psychopathology on mother-infant relations. While an emerging body of research largely supports this idea, the relative importance of differences in the trajectory of repetitive negative thinking during and after pregnancy for mother-infant bonding as well as maternal depressive symptoms is currently unknown. Therefore, we investigated associations between the course of maternal repetitive negative thinking during pregnancy and after birth and mother-infant-bonding and maternal depressive symptoms in a longitudinal study. The overall level of repetitive negative thinking was a significant predictor of mother-infant bonding, maternal anxiety and rejection in dealing with her infant four months after birth. Furthermore, differences in the trajectory of repetitive negative thinking predicted bonding, but not anxiety or rejection. The overall levels of repetitive negative thinking as well as the differences in the trajectory of repetitive negative thinking were significant predictors of maternal depressive symptoms. These findings indicate that changes of repetitive negative thinking during and after pregnancy can increase the risk of postpartum depressive symptoms.

"Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 acts as a tumor suppressor that inhibits the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway due to blocking insulin growth factor-1 binding to its receptor. We hypothesized that insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 might be targeted by microRNA-125b and promote tumor invasion and poor outcome in non-small-cell lung cancer via activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry were performed to determine the level of microRNA-125b, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 messenger RNA, and phosphorylated-AKT expression in 105 tumors from non-small-cell lung cancer patients. Low insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 messenger RNA levels and positive phosphorylated-AKT expression were more commonly found in patients with high microRNA-125b tumors than low microRNA-125b tumors. A poorer overall survival and relapse-free survival were observed in patients with high microRNA-125b tumors than low-microRNA-125b tumors in p53-mutated patients, but not in p53-wild-type patients. Mechanistically, microRNA-125b promotes invasion ability in p53-mutated cells via the PI3K/AKT activation by targeting of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3, but this effect was not observed in p53-wild-type cells. An increase in phosphorylated-AKT expression due to targeting of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 by microRNA-125b was responsible for cell invasion in p53-mutated cells. In conclusion, the microRNA-125b level promotes invasive ability in p53-mutated cells via PI3K/AKT activation by targeting of insulinlike growth factor-binding protein-3, thereby resulting in p53-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer patients with poor outcomes.

"Transfusion of blood cell components is frequent in the therapeutic arsenal; it is globally safe or even very safe. At present, residual clinical manifestations are principally inflammatory in nature. If some rare clinical hazards manifest as acute inflammation symptoms of various origin, most of them linked with conflicting and undesirable biological material accompanying the therapeutic component (infectious pathogen, pathogenic antibody, unwanted antigen, or allergen), the general feature is subtler and less visible, and essentially consists of alloimmunization or febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction. The present essay aims to present updates in hematology and immunology that help understand how, when, and why subclinical inflammation underlies alloimmunization and circumstances characteristic of red blood cells and - even more frequently - platelets that contribute inflammatory mediators. Modern transfusion medicine makes sustained efforts to limit such inflammatory hazards; efforts can be successful only if one has a clear view of each element's role.

"This work aimed to determine the presence of Arcobacter spp. in shellfish and to determine its susceptibility to quinolones. One hundred samples (41 mussels, 37 clams, and 22 cockles) were purchased from different local retail shops in Valencia, Spain, from September 2013 to June 2015. All samples were analyzed simultaneously by culture, after an enrichment step, and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), directly and after enrichment. The susceptibility to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin of the isolates was tested using the disk-diffusion test and E-test strips method. To clarify the mechanism of quinolone resistance, a fragment of the quinolone resistance-determining region of the gyrA gene was sequenced. Thirty-seven samples were positive and 49 isolates were obtained by culture, and Arcobacter spp. DNA was detected in 32% of the samples by PCR. However, after 48-h enrichment, the number of positive samples increased, and 68 of the 100 samples yielded the specific Arcobacter spp. PCR product. In addition, 49 isolates were identified by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The most commonly found species was Arcobacter butzleri (25 isolates, 51.03%) followed by Arcobacter cryaerophilus (19 isolates, 38.77%) and Arcobacter defluvii (5 isolates, 10.20%). Only three isolates of A. butzleri were resistant to both antibiotics. A mutation C to T transition in the position 254 of the gyrA gene was present in the three resistant isolates. This study confirms that pathogenic arcobacters are frequently found in edible shellfish samples. Moreover, this is the first time that A. butzleri and A. cryaerophilus have been isolated from cockles.

"Arbitrary fractional order integrator can be designed by a method of constructing the rational approximation function in the form of continued product. This paper takes half order integrator as an example to exhibit the design process. The circuit is made up of level-N active operational amplifier network in which the size of N is equal to the order of rational function. Since the rational approximation function in the form of continued product consists of several first order damp elements and first derivative elements, it will greatly simplify the design process of fractional integrator. It only needs four different resistors and a series of regular capacitors. Thanks to the properties, the fractional integrator can be easily manufactured for industrial production and commercial purpose. It shows that the designed fractional integrator based on the proposed method is rational through performance simulations comparison with other methods and the test by Multisim 10.

"Fusarium wilts of strawberry, caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. fragariae, is a serious soil-borne disease. Fusarium wilt causes dramatic yield losses in commercial strawberry production and it is a very stubborn disease to control. Reliable chemical control of strawberry Fusarium wilt disease is not yet available. Moreover, other well-known F. oxysporum have different genetic information from F. oxysporum F.. sp. fragariae. This analysis investigates the genetic diversity of strawberry Fusairum wilt pathogen. In total, 110 pathogens were isolated from three major strawberry production regions, namely Sukok, Hadong, Sancheong in Gyeongnam province in South Korea. The isolates were confirmed using F. oxysporum f. sp. fragariae species-specific primer sets. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analyses were executed using the internal transcribed spacer, intergenic spacer, translation elongation factorl-alpha, and beta-tubulin genes of the pathogens and four restriction enzymes: AluI, HhaI and Hpy1I. Regarding results, there were diverse patterns in the three gene regions except for the beta-tubulin gene region. Correlation analysis of strawberry cultivation region, cultivation method, variety, and phenotype of isolated pathogen, confirmed that genetic diversity depended on the classification of the cultivated region.

"A novel hybrid system composed of a photocatalytic fuel cell (PFC) and Fenton reactor was developed with the aim to degrade the azo dye Reactive Black 5 (RB5) and generate electricity. Compared to previously established system of bioelectro-Fenton system, microbial fuel cell (MFC) system has significant challenge in the development and operation system. Therefore, PFC is used instead of MFC to generate electrons for the Fenton system. The effect of azo dye (RB5) on each PFC and Fenton reactor was investigated. The experimental results showed that maximum power output was achieved in the absence of dye in the Fenton reactor of this hybrid system. Furthermore, higher degradation efficiency of RB5 could also be observed in the PFC reactor in this hybrid system. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"Studies have demonstrated low expression of miR-145 associated with cell proliferation and migration in a wide variety of tumors. Here, we studied the expression of miR-145 in relation to the occurrence and development of breast cancer. Total RNA from breast cancer tissue and corresponding adjacent normal tissue was extracted and used to detect miR-145 expression by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). We also transfected breast cancer cells with hsa-miR-145 mimics, hsa-miR-145 inhibitor, mimics negative control (mimics NC) or inhibitor negative control (inhibitor NC). Cell proliferation was analyzed by colony formation assays and methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assays. Cell proliferation in breast cancer cells was decreased after overexpression of miR-145 and increased following miR-145 suppression. Cell migration and invasion were assessed using Transwell and wound healing assays, respectively, and were also decreased after overexpression of miR-145 and increased after miR-145 suppression in breast cancer cells. Finally, western blot assays showed that over expression of miR-145 inhibited expression of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1). Collectively, these data suggest that miR-145 may inhibit TGF-beta 1 protein expression which may in turn contribute to tumor formation.

"Jet electrochemical machining is a promising shaping method that has the potential to replace traditional sinking ECM in the industry owing to its flexibility and stability. However, its machining quality is impaired by the occurrence of a unique phenomenon (i.e., the anode cannot be uniformly dissolved with high nozzle travel rate). This paper aims to analyze this unique phenomenon from the viewpoint of anodic behavior and to select the optimum travel rate parameter window. The anodic behavior of TB6 titanium alloy in sodium chloride solution was investigated by linear sweep voltammetry, cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and chronoamperometry. A time-dependent mechanism of pitting/large localized corrosion/polishing for the anodic interface structure was developed. The full electricity quantity of the equivalent oxide layer capacitor, Q, was proposed as a criterion for the initiation of uniform dissolution state. Subsequently, a novel model that incorporates the parameter Q was developed to account for the effect of anodic behavior. This model is able to predict the machined profile as well as the localized corrosion range. Finally, the effect of nozzle travel rate on jet ECM performance was investigated, and a nozzle travel rate of 10 to 25 mu m s(-1) was selected as the optimum parameter window in the present work.

"The interleaved multilevel DC-DC converters have advantages of low voltage stress of the switches and diodes and reduction of filter size. Particularly series input parallel output (ISOP) configuration is well suited for high output voltage and large output current application but input series output series (ISOS) configuration enable the utilization of low voltage rating switches in high voltage input and high voltage output applications that require galvanic isolation. The series connection of the isolated DC-DC converters at the input side also can be used for higher voltage application. While multilevel topology offers many new features, it also necessitates a balance control of the input capacitors. The paper describes the operating principles of the balancing circuit, analyzes the fundamental relationships, introduces principles of the operation of the circuit. The paper shows experimental results based on a few practical application examples. The paper discusses design of the transformer with balancing winding for ISOP, ISOS and parallel connection of the DC-DC converters to provide independent voltage balancing of input capacitors.

"Xyloglucan endotransglycosylase (XET) catalyses the transglycosylation of xyloglucan, the major hemicellulose polymer, which has been thought to mediate the cross-linking of cellulose microfibrils in cellular walls and proposed to be involved in the control of cell wall relaxation. To understand the relationship between litchi fruit cracking and gene expression patterns, three XET genes from litchi fruit were identified and then examined for their expression profiles in pericarp and aril tissues at different development stages, using a cracking-resistant cultivar, 'Huaizhi', and a cracking-susceptible cultivar, 'Nuomici'. Three full-length cDNAs of 1267, 1095 and 1156 bp encoding XETs, named LcXET1, LcXET2 and LcXET3, respectively, were isolated from expanding fruit using RT-PCR and RACE-PCR (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) methods. Northern blotting analysis showed that LcXET1 mRNA accumulation occurred much earlier in aril tissues at 59 days after anthesis (DAA) than in pericarp tissues at 73 DAA in 'Nuomici'. However, it appeared at almost the same time (66 DAA) in pericarp and aril tissues in 'Huaizhi'. which suggested that differential accumulation of LcXET1 in pericarp and aril tissues in 'Nuomici' and 'Huaizhi' was closely associated with fruit cracking. LcXET2 mRNA accumulation could be detected in pericarp and aril tissues throughout fruit development but exhibited a differential accumulation pattern between pericarp and aril tissues. In the aril of 'Nuomici', intensive signal bands were detectable at 59-73 DAA in rapidly expanding fruits of 'Nuomici' but only weak bands could be found in the pericarp tissues. In contrast, moderate signal bands were detectable both in pericarp and aril tissues of 'Huaizhi' fruits. Furthermore, LeXET3 showed constitutive expression in both pericarp and aril tissues of developing 'Nuomici' and 'Huaizhi' litchi fruit. In addition, differential expression patterns of three XETs genes were observed in different tissues of litchi, with only LcXET1 being fruit-specific. To further address the role of LcXET in fruit cracking, alpha-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) was used to treat 'Nuomoci' to reduce fruit cracking. Enhanced LcXET1 mRNA accumulation appeared in pericarp while LcXET2 and LeXET3 mRNTA accumulation enhanced in aril tissues in the NAA-treated fruits. Thus, LcXET1 is more likely to play a role in reducing litchi fruit cracking than LcXET2 and LcXET3. (c) 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

"This study aimed to identify and analyze the prevalence of physical and psychological family violence in a sample of children and adolescents with different categories of disabilities in a hospital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This was a cross-sectional observational study based on application of the Parent-Child Conflict Tactics Scale in a sample of 270 parents or guardians. Prevalence was 83.7% for psychological aggression and 84.4% for physical maltreatment, while 96.5% of the children and adolescents with disabilities that suffered physical punishment were also victims of psychological aggression ( p < 0.01) and 100% of those who suffered severe physical maltreatment also suffered psychological aggression ( p = 0.01). Children and adolescents with disabilities showed increased risk of suffering family violence compared to those without disabilities. In conclusion, there is a need for greater awareness-raising and training of health teams for detection and notification of child abuse, and efforts should be made to support these families.

"Increasing research efforts are exploring the racial/ethnic composition of the population served by the U.S. child welfare system (CWS); however, only limited research has examined the unique experiences of CWS-involved Latino/Latina children and families, particularly those reported for child sexual abuse (CSA). This lack of research is troubling given that Latinos/Latinas are this country's largest and fastest growing minority group. To address this knowledge gap, this secondary data analysis uses data from the 2012 National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System Child File to examine a sample of children reported to the CWS (N = 2,401,304) and subsample of children involved in CSA reports (n = 179,199). Using descriptive and bivariate analyses, we describe a national profile of CWS-involved Latino/Latina children reported for CSA. This profile is developed based on the child characteristics of the analytic sample, rates of case substantiation, report sources, perpetrator characteristics, and caretaker risk factors. We then compare the profile of this subgroup of Latino/Latina children with the profiles of children who are non-Latino/Latina Black or non-Latino/Latina White. Results indicate several significant differences exist between the profiles of CWS-involved Latino/Latina children with a CSA report as compared with their counterparts in other racial/ethnic groups. Findings are discussed with the aim of informing practice, policy, and research on sexual abuse prevention and intervention strategies for Latino/Latina populations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"The genus Brucella causes significant economic losses due to infertility, abortion, stillbirth or weak calves, and neonatal mortality in livestock. Brucellosis is still a zoonosis of public health importance worldwide. The study was aimed to optimize and evaluate PCR assays used for the diagnosis of Brucella infections. For this aim, several primers and PCR protocols were performed and compared with Brucella cultures and biological material inoculated with Brucella. In PCR assays, genus- or species-specific oligonucleotide primers derived from 16S rRNA sequences (F4/R2, Ba148/928, IS711, BruP6-P7) and OMPs (JPF/JPR, 31ter/sd) of Brucella were used. All primers except for BruP6-P7 detected the DNA from reference Brucella strains and field isolates. In spiked blood, milk, and semen samples, F4-R2 primer-oriented PCR assays detected minimal numbers of Brucella. In spiked serum and fetal stomach content, Ba148/928 primer-oriented PCR assays detected minimal numbers of Brucella. Field samples collected from sheep and cattle were examined by bacteriological methods and optimized PCR assays. Overall, sensitivity of PCR assays was found superior to conventional bacteriological isolation. Brucella DNA was detected in 35.1, 1.1, 24.8, 5.0, and 8.0% of aborted fetus, blood, milk, semen, and serum samples by PCR assays, respectively. In conclusion, PCR assay in optimized conditions was found to be valuable in sensitive and specific detection of Brucella infections of animals.

A case study in Lhasa city was further carried out in order to evaluate the energy and economic performance of the developed model. The results indicated that solar photovoltaic systems are preferred than solar thermal systems for typical office buildings in cold plateau areas with rich solar energy resources. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate the influences of financial subsidies and commercial electricity prices on the system economical performance. Furthermore, life cycle assessment was conducted to compare and analyze the performances of an optimization system and a conventional system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"Background/Aims: Liver injury results in the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which in turn produce matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines for tissue remodelling. This study explored the transcriptional induction of the MMP-1 gene by tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in HSCs. Methods: The LI90 human HSC line was used in the present study. Gelatin zymography, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Northern blotting and gene promoter-reporter assays were used to analyse the induction of MMP-1 protein, mRNA expression and gene transcription respectively. Deletional or site-directed mutations were introduced into the promoter region and transiently transfected into LI90 cells to determine the cis-acting elements necessary for TNF-alpha inducibility. Gel shift mobility assays were used to determine the transcriptional factors involved in the TNF-alpha responsiveness. Results: TNF-alpha upregulated MMP-1 protein and mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner. A time-course experiment revealed a rapid induction of MMP-1 mRNA expression after TNF-alpha treatment. Mutation in a putative nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B-binding site at -2541 bp almost completely abolished the TNF-alpha response to MMP-1 gene-promoter activity, suggesting transcriptional regulation of MMP-1 expression by TNF-alpha via this site. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and supershift assays indicated that this transcriptional regulation was regulated via the p50/p50 homodimer of NF-kappa B. Conclusions: MMP-1 gene expression might be induced by TNF-alpha via the p50/p50 homodimer of NF-kappa B in activated human HSCs.

"Treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) over the past four decades remains mostly unchanged and the prognosis for the majority of patients remains poor. Most of the significant advances that have been observed are in defining cytogenetic abnormalities, as well as the genetic and epigenetic profiles of AML patients. While new cytogenetic and genetic aberrations such as the FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations are able to guide prognosis for the majority of patients with AML, outcomes are still dismal and relapse rates remain high. It is thought that relapse in AML is in part driven by minimal residual disease (MRD) that remains in the patient following treatment. Thus, there is a need for sensitive and objective methodology for MRD detection. Methodologies such as multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC), quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR), digital PCR (dPCR), or next-generation sequencing (NGS) are being employed to evaluate their utility in MRD assessment. In this review, we will provide an overview of AML and the clinical utility of MRD measurement. We will discuss optimal timing to MRD measurement, the different approaches that are available, and efforts in the standardization across laboratories.

"Research has tried to identify risk factors that increase the likelihood of difficulties with externalizing behavior. The relations between individual or environmental factors and externalizing behavior have been especially documented. Child-oriented and parent-oriented interventions have been designed in order to decrease externalizing behavior in preschoolers. To date, however, research has largely been compartmentalized. It is therefore not known whether child-oriented or parent-oriented intervention is more effective in reducing externalizing behavior. The aim of the current study was to answer this question by comparing two 8-week child with two 8-week parent-oriented group programs sharing a common experimental design. This was done in a pseudo-randomized trial conducted with 73 3-6-year-old children displaying clinically relevant levels of externalizing behavior who were assigned to one of the four interventions and 20 control participants who were allocated to a waiting list. The results indicate that the four programs focusing on a specific target variable, i.e., social cognition, inhibition, parental self-efficacy beliefs, or parental verbal responsiveness, are all effective in reducing externalizing behavior among preschoolers. Their effectiveness was moderated neither by their orientation toward the child or the parent nor by their content, suggesting that several effective solutions exist to improve behavioral adaptation in preschoolers. A second important highlight of this study is that, thanks to comparable effect sizes, brief focused programs appear to be a reasonable alternative to long multimodal programs, and may be more cost-effective for children and their families.

"The objective of this work was to comparatively study the tissue tropism and the associated pathology of 2 autochthonous small ruminant lentivirus (SRLV) field strains using an experimental infection in sheep through the bone marrow. Fifteen male, SRLV-free lambs of the Rasa Aragonesa breed were inoculated with strain 697 (nervous tissue origin, animals A1-A6), with strain 496 (articular origin, animals B1-B6), or with uninfected culture medium (C1-C3). Clinical, serologic, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) evaluations were performed periodically. Two lambs from each infected group and a control animal were euthanized at 134, 273, and 319 days postinfection. Tissues were analyzed by gross and histopathologic evaluation; immunohistochemistry for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD68, and FoxP3 cell markers; lung morphometric evaluation; and tissue proviral quantification by PCR. All infected animals became positive either by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and/or PCR, with group B lambs showing the highest serologic values and more consistently positive PCR reactions. Group A lambs showed representative lung lesions but only mild histopathologic changes in the central nervous system (CNS) or in carpal joints. Contrarily, group B lambs demonstrated intense carpal arthritis and interstitial pneumonia but an absence of lesions in the CNS. Proviral copies in tissues were detected only in group B lambs. Experimental infection with these SRLV strains indicates that strain 496 is more virulent than strain 697 and more prone to induce arthritis, whereas strain 697 is more likely to reproduce encephalitis in Rasa Aragonesa lambs. Host factors as well as viral factors are responsible for the final clinicopathologic picture during SRLV infections.

"In many proteins, especially allosteric proteins that communicate regulatory states from allosteric to active sites, structural deformations are functionally important. To understand these deformations, dynamical experiments are ideal but challenging. Using static structural information, although more limited than dynamical analysis, is much more accessible. Underused for protein analysis, strain is the natural quantity for studying local deformations. We calculate strain tensor fields for proteins deformed by ligands or thermal fluctuations using crystal and NMR structure ensembles. Strains-primarily shears-show deformations around binding sites. These deformations can be induced solely by ligand binding at distant allosteric sites. Shears reveal quasi-2D paths of mechanical coupling between allosteric and active sites that may constitute a widespread mechanism of allostery. We argue that strain-particularly shear-is the most appropriate quantity for analysis of local protein deformations. This analysis can reveal mechanical and biological properties of many proteins.

"This paper describes the main characteristics and the performance of a saturated core type fault current limiter (FCL) rated 45MVA(33 kV-800 A) to be provided by ASG Power Systems. The FCL, which has been submitted to preliminary laboratory testing, will be installed at a 275/33 kV substation in the U.K. and will reduce the fault current by 38%. The device is based on an open geometry of the magnetic cores which allows reduced size and the weight. Magnetic saturation of the cores is obtained by means of two magnesium diboride (MgB2) magnets. A numerical model of the FCL has been developed and validated and the interaction of the device with the power grid has been investigated. Details and results of the model are also discussed in the paper.

"Whether specific T-cell clones are present in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in BCC is unknown. We employed deep sequencing of mRNA coding for the T-cell receptor (TCR) chains - and to characterize the repertoire of TILs in BCC. V and J gene-usage and CDR3 length were computed to determine the clonality of TCR and degree of overlap in TCR repertoires between skin resident T-cells and TILs. We found high diversity of the TCR repertoire in BCC and control skin with random V-J gene usage and similar CDR3-length distribution. Lack of TCR repertoire restriction indicates absence of tumor-specific TIL clones in BCC.
